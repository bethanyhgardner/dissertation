    "text": "0.1 Overview\nAs the use of they/them pronouns becomes more common and more accepted, an increasing number of speakers find themselves making seemingly paradoxical errors, such as in the following headline:\n\nExample 1 \nDemi Lovatoi thanks Lizzo for correcting paparazzo who misgendered heri: “I love you.”\nThe “Dancing With The Devil” singeri came out as nonbinary in May and goes by “they/them” pronouns.\n— Entertainment Weekly (Towers, 2021)\n\nThe article describes a press interview where Lizzo corrects paparazzi misgendering Lovato. In the quoted exchange, Lizzo is asked a question about collaborating with Lovato that uses she/her to refer to Lovato. Lizzo corrects this, the question is repeated still using she/her, and Lizzo states twice more that Lovato uses they/them. Although the paparazzi did not change their pronoun use in this conversation, Lovato was grateful for the support. Despite the article being about misgendering and they/them pronouns, the author does not consistently use they/them to refer to Lovato. However, it is unlikely that the author entirely refuses to use singular they or the publication prohibits it, as several references to Lovato in the middle of the article are correct. Instead, the author appears to not have noticed the alternations between she/her and they/them, despite the context making accurate use of they/them pronouns as salient as possible, and despite good intentions.\nOne of the starting questions of this dissertation is why do people do this? Why are errors like “she uses they/them pronouns” common, where the speaker knows that a particular person uses they/them, recalls it in the conversational context, and expresses support for that person’s identity, but still produces she instead of they when referring to them? The growing support for and familiarity with singular they during the past few years suggests that many people are open to learning (Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019), and that a substantial part of the barrier causing frequent misgendering comes from lower-level language processes for producing pronouns, as opposed to higher-level attitudes about gender and language.\nIn addition to learning that the grammatical representation of they allows it to corefer with specific singular referents (i.e., proper names), the learning process may require a change from accessing a person’s pronoun (he or she) based on semantic/conceptual features of a person (e.g., Antón-Méndez, 2010), or based on morphosyntactic gender marking associated with a person’s name (e.g., Schmitt et al., 1999). The first three experiments argue for a model where, in order to use singular they correctly, speakers may instead need to retrieve information from episodic memory about a person’s stated pronouns or which pronouns other speakers use to refer to them. Experiment 1 establishes a measure for how people learn to associate pronouns with a person, and how they use this information to select which pronouns to produce. Experiment 2 investigates how providing people with information about why paying attention to gendered language is important and how seeing singular they modeled can support memory for and production of they/them pronouns. Experiment 3 moves from written to spoken production, testing how including pronouns on nametags and in introductions—common EDI recommendations—affects pronoun choice. Finally, Experiment 4 investigates online comprehension, using the visual world paradigm to characterize the processing of they coreferring with proper names. Before that, the remainder of this introduction reviews terminology about coreference and gender; prior research about the acceptability, comprehension, and production of singular they; and the sociopolitical context of misgendering."

    "section": "0.2 Terminology",
    "text": "0.2 Terminology\n\n0.2.1 Coreference\nIn conversations and writing, we use a variety of expressions to refer to the same entity, and keeping track of this—doing coreference resolution—is one of the core problems of language comprehension (Cornish, 2006; Garnham & Cowles, 2006; Huang, 2006). When talking about people, speakers have the choice between proper names (Bethany, Bethany Gardner), pronouns (they, she), role nouns (the author), and other noun phrase descriptions (the author of this dissertation). Comprehenders have to identify who is being talked about when a person is first mentioned, then match later referring expressions back to that referent. Pronouns nearly always refer to someone mentioned previously—an antecedent—instead of introducing a new referent (Kennison et al., 2009). However, in many contexts there are multiple possible antecedents for the same pronoun, and understanding how comprehenders successfully manage this has been the focus of decades of psycholinguistics research. As a brief summary, one class of theories argues that comprehenders identify the referent based on which entities are currently “centered” in attention, which is determined primarily based on grammatical roles (e.g., the subject of the sentence) and information structure (e.g., topic changes) (Gordon et al., 1993; Grosz & Sidner, 1986; Joshi et al., 2006; Walker, 2002). The second major class of theories, coherence-driven approaches, argues that coreference resolution is a consequence of broader inferential reasoning using world knowledge to construct an interpretation of the conversation as a whole (Greene et al., 1992; McKoon et al., 1996). While centering and coherence approaches have generally been considered mutually exclusive, one way of reconciling them is a probabilistic model where comprehenders are using coherence-driven expectations about what entities the speaker will refer to next, and speakers are using centering-driven likelihoods to choose referential forms (Kehler & Rohde, 2013). Aside from the terminology used for reference resolution, the key takeaway for the rest of this dissertation is that coreference—even for neutral, established, uncontroversial pronouns like he and she—is complicated.\n\n\n0.2.2 Gender in Linguistics\nIn a linguistics context, gender can refer to multiple concepts: grammatical, conceptual, and social. First, grammatical gender refers to linguistic features. Languages with grammatical gender systems (e.g., Spanish, French, and German) classify nouns by gender; and determiners, pronouns, and adjectives have morphosyntactic features that mark agreement with the noun’s gender (Gygax et al., 2019). For example, book is a masculine noun in Spanish (libroMASC), so the masculine forms of determiners are used (e.g., elMASC instead of laFEM) and adjectives are conjugated with the masculine ending (e.g., nuevoMASC instead of nuevaFEM), resulting in phrases like elMASC libroMASC nuevoMASC for the new book. Here, gender means something more like kind or class, and while many grammatical gender languages label the classes as masculine, feminine, and neutral, some languages have more than two or three genders (Corbett, 2013a). Most gender classifications of nouns in grammatical gender languages are clearly arbitrary—there is nothing about a book that makes it masculine or feminine. Instead, grammatical gender can be thought of as a component of the word’s structure, not its meaning (Antón-Méndez et al., 2002; Wang & Schiller, 2019).\nLanguages without grammatical gender, such as English, are typically referred to as natural gender languages. Natural gender languages do not group nouns into gender classes, but many do mark gender for pronouns referring to people (Gygax et al., 2019; Siewierska, 2013). Gender marking of pronouns in natural gender languages is so-called because it is assumed to reflect inherent biological categories (e.g., Corbett (2013b); critiqued by McConnell-Ginet (2014)). This becomes a problem if you acknowledge that gender (and to some degree, biological sex) is a social construction with the potential to have more than two binary categories. With regard to pronouns, a better explanation—in terms of gender theory as well as simply explaining linguistic behavior—is to treat pronouns as reflecting a shared social understanding, instead of an ontological or biological claim (Conrod (2019b), discussed in more detail later in Section 0.5). With regard to nouns, instead of calling this natural gender, I refer to this as conceptual gender, following Ackerman (2019).\nIn addition to accounting for modern concepts of social gender, decoupling gendered language from claims about inherent natural categories also facilitates making distinctions between two different ways that nouns can carry conceptual gender information, which become relevant in psycholinguistics experiments. In definitionally-gendered nouns, the gender information is part of the meaning itself, e.g., son or queen. In stereotypically-gendered nouns, gender information is part of our knowledge about gender stereotypes, distributions, and expectations, e.g., mechanic or nurse. Even if they do not believe this should be the case, people know that being a mechanic fits better into expectations for men and being a nurse fits better into expectations for women, and that people employed as mechanics are more likely to be men and people employed as nurses are more likely to be women. Similarly, English first names carry probabilistic information about gender. When talking about names for the design of the experiments in this dissertation, I refer to people’s knowledge about gender associations of a name (i.e., that most people named Mary are women, or that people named Jordan are commonly men or women).1\nPart of coreference resolution requires evaluating whether a potential antecedent matches the pronoun for features including gender and number. Which aspect(s) of gender, precisely, are being evaluated? Grammatical, conceptual, or social? Since modern English does not have grammatical gender, Ackerman (2019) argues that we are using conceptual gender (see Sato et al. (2013) for similar empirical findings). In order to distinguish how grammatical, conceptual, and social gender may be cognitively and linguistically encoded, Ackerman presents a three-tier model of gender agreement. The exemplar tier represents knowledge about our experiences with cues about gender, including the gender associations of first names, clothing and hair styles, vocal pitch, and other speech characteristics indexed as masculine or feminine. The distribution on the exemplar tier is strongly bimodal for most people, but would change as someone gains more experience with gender-nonconforming and nonbinary people. The category tier represents our cognitive categorizations about gender, conceptualized as two discrete, non-overlapping categories laid over the bimodal distribution of the exemplar tier. Children develop categories for gender early on, and people automatically categorize others as male or female, regardless of whether these inferences are accurate or necessary (Bussey & Bandura, 1999; Fagot & Leinbach, 1993; Friedman, 2014; Martin et al., 2002; Martin & Ruble, 2004; Waxman, 2010). This tendency in language comprehension is discussed later in Section 0.4.1. Finally, the feature tier represents labels and grammatical features associated with the categories on the category tier. In summary, being precise about what we mean when we say conceptual gender requires making distinctions between the knowledge and experiences we use to make gender inferences, the categories we infer from that knowledge and experience, and the labels we assign to those categories.\n\n\n0.2.3 Forms of Singular They\nForms of singular they vary in three primary aspects—definiteness, specificity, and gender information—and the usage becomes more contested as referents become more definite, specific, and gender-known (Bjorkman, 2017; Conrod, 2019b; Konnelly & Cowper, 2020). Broadly speaking, definite forms, including proper names and noun phrases with the, allow the comprehender to identify a referent; indefinite forms, including noun phrases with a/an, do not (Abbott, 2006). Generic forms refer to a group of people, while specific forms refer to an individual (Carlson, 2006; Farkas, 2006; Fodor & Sag, 1982). Definiteness and specificity are distinct features here, since expressions can be specific but indefinite—referring to one referent within a group, but not specifying which one.\nThe oldest and most common form of singular they is the generic indefinite:\n\nExample 2 \nThere’s not a mani I meet but doth salute me\nAs if I were theiri well-acquainted friend\n— A Comedy of Errors (Shakespeare, 1623)\n\n\nExample 3 \nEverybodyi was punctual, everybodyi in theiri best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.\n— Emma (Austen, 1815)\n\nThis form dates back to late Middle English, with some of the earliest examples appearing in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and has been in continuous use since then (Balhorn, 2004; Baskervill & Sewell, 1895; OED Online, 2021). In the 18th century, prescriptive grammarians started pushing for the exclusive use of he as a generic (Bodine, 1975), which I discuss more in Section 0.8. Currently, generic indefinite singular they is widely accepted (Hekanaho, 2020). The majority of style guides allow it, but still recommend using the phrase he or she or rephrasing the sentence to be plural (Robertson, 2021).\nCompared to the generic indefinite, specific definite forms of singular they show much more variation in acceptability and frequency. It can be used in several gender-unspecified contexts, such as when the speaker does not know the referent’s gender. This context implies that the referent’s gender is unknown, not necessarily that they are nonbinary or use they/them pronouns (Conrod, 2019b). The other speaker can add more information, either directly as in Example 4, or indirectly through modeling pronoun use in a subsequent utterance.\n\nExample 4 \nA: Oh, okay, okay, um…What—Would you mind telling me what happened? Uh, what theyi did?\nB: Hei.\nA: Did hei look like hei hadn’t slept in about a week?\n— The Magnus Archives, pre-scripted podcast (Sims & Newall, 2019)\n\nTypically, if information about the referent’s gender becomes available, speakers will switch to using he or she. The primary variance I observe is whether people hedge an unknown with they, or make a potentially incorrect guess with he or she. This form is also used in contexts where the speaker knows the gender of the referent and the addressee does not, but the speaker does not include that information. This seems to be most common when referring to people by relationships or contexts instead of by name, since the addressee does not know them (e.g., my friend from undergrad). Example 5 shows a conversation where Speaker B interprets Speaker A’s use of singular they as gender-unspecified. When Speaker A introduces the referent’s name, Speaker B uses this information to switch from gender-unspecified they to specifying he. Speaker A then has to clarify that they had meant gender-specified they, where the referent uses they/them not he/him:\n\nExample 5 \nA: A friendi of mine…they’vei sort of dropped off the face of the earth and I’m worried about themi. I wouldn’t normally go this crazy about this, but I wanted to make sure they’rei alright. I just have a weird feeling about it all.\nB: What’s theiri name?\nA: Beni. Ben Bernardi.\nB: Put your number in and I’ll let you know if I find himi.\nA: Themi.\nB: Got it, great.\n— The College Tapes, pre-scripted podcast (Snow & Shippen, 2021)\n\nThe specific, definite, and gender-specified form of singular they—the context described by “using they/them pronouns”—is the newest and most contested form. Although English first names do not carry definitive gender information, most carry strong probabilistic information and are perceived as gendered. Singular they coreferring with a proper name is carrying information about the referent’s gender, not leaving it unspecified, e.g.:\n\nExample 6 \nHowelli is about to graduate from college, and finding the perfect job isn’t necessarily theiri top priority. They’rei thinking holistically about community, joy, and fulfillment. Theyi are also looking beyond theiri 20s.\n— “The one-size-fits-all narrative of your 20s needs to change,” The Atlantic (Stauffer, 2021)\n\n\nExample 7 \nWithout warning, Francisi kicks theiri free leg against the table. It does not move…Theiri chest rises and falls rapidly as theyi are lowered into the only seat, the dusty air of the theater scratching theiri throat and drying theiri mouth.\n— The Magnus Archives, pre-scripted podcast (Sims & Newall, 2020)\n\n\nExample 8 \nWith my work I think you definitely know the male figurei is isolated, um, feels unaccepted, feels, uh, um, just that theyi have no identity.\n— “Other Voices: Matthew Neenan,” video interview (Neenan, 2020)\n\nSingular they coreferring with definitionally-gendered role nouns behaves similarly (see Bjorkman (2017); Konnelly & Cowper (2020)). However, these usages are less common, likely because people who use they/them pronouns often also prefer gender-neutral titles (e.g., Mx) and role nouns (e.g., sibling) (Cassian, 2021, 2022). Cases where the speaker unambiguously marks gender in one form of reference but not in pronouns do occur, such as Example 8. This usage is not as relevant to the current questions, since speakers are rarely asked to produce it, but what discourse factors cause speakers to spontaneously produce it is a question for future research.\n\n\n0.2.4 LGBTQ Identity\nHere, I use trans and gender diverse (TGD) as an umbrella term for anyone whose gender is different than their sex assigned at birth (what was put on their birth certificate) and cisgender as an umbrella term for anyone whose gender matches their sex assigned at birth. People use a variety of terms to describe their identities, which currently include transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, and queer (Cassian, 2021, 2022; GLAAD, 2020; Harrison et al., 2012; James et al., 2016; Kuper et al., 2012). Currently, nonbinary is the most common label for people whose gender is not entirely within the categories of male or female, some of whom also identify as trans (Cassian, 2021, 2022; GLAAD, 2020; James et al., 2016; Wilson & Meyer, 2021). While many nonbinary people use they/them pronouns, not all do, and not all people who use they/them are nonbinary. Pronouns are one of the cues we use to convey gender, and they strongly correlate with gender identity, but the mapping is not a one-to-one rule. Because of this, I specify “people who use they/them pronouns” instead of “nonbinary people” or “nonbinary pronouns.” Otherwise, when describing prior research findings, I use the authors’ terminology, noting that variations in the language used to recruit and describe participants select for different subsets of the TGD community."

    "section": "0.3 Acceptability and Grammaticality",
    "text": "0.3 Acceptability and Grammaticality\nMuch of the recent linguistics research on singular they has focused on acceptability and grammaticality judgments. People’s acceptability judgments tend to fall into one of three patterns: “Non-innovators” only accept generic antecedents for singular they (e.g., each person, everyone) and do not accept any specific antecedents. In addition to generic antecedents, “innovators” accept specific, but only gender-unspecified antecedents for singular they (e.g., my friend). To accommodate proper names, “innovative” speakers can add a new version of the name to their linguistic knowledge that is not grammatically marked as masculine or feminine. This means that they can accept singular they for a person that they have learned uses they/them pronouns, but implies that it occurs through an exception to their gender agreement system, not a change to it. Finally, “super-innovators” accept any singular antecedents for they, including gender-specified ones (e.g., definitionally-gendered nouns like sister, any proper names) (Bjorkman, 2017; Camilliere et al., 2021; Konnelly & Cowper, 2020).\nSeveral factors have been repeatedly demonstrated to correlate with acceptability judgments. People who are younger (Conrod, 2019b; Hekanaho, 2020; Parker et al., 2019), who are LGBTQ+ (Hernandez, 2020; Nichols et al., 2019), and who know trans and gender diverse people (Ackerman et al., 2017; Hekanaho, 2020) consider singular they more acceptable. Attitudes about gender play a role: unsurprisingly, people who express more support of TGD people are more likely to consider singular they acceptable (Hekanaho, 2020; Hernandez, 2020). Benevolent sexism, which measures endorsement of traditional gender roles and belief in binary gender essentialism, is negatively correlated with acceptability ratings; but hostile sexism, which measures overt hostility towards women, has not been shown to be related (Bradley, 2020).\nBeliefs about grammar and language change are among the most commonly cited metalinguistic reasons for disliking singular they (Bodine, 1975; Hekanaho, 2020). People who strongly endorse linguistic prescriptivism, which values “correct” language use and opposes changes to this standard, rate singular they as less acceptable (Bradley, 2020). Conversely, support of non-sexist language reform, which often focuses on avoiding masculine forms as the generic or the default, predicts higher acceptance of singular they (Hekanaho, 2020). Notably, predictors of attitudes about singular they now are similar to predictors of attitudes about non-sexist language reform in the 1980s and 1990s. Alternatives to using he as the generic include phrases like he/she and he or she, as well as using singular they or she as a generic. People who were younger, who agreed that despite advances in equality women still face less-overt forms of sexism (Swim et al., 1995), and who had less conservative views about gender roles were more likely to support non-sexist language reform (Jacobson & Insko, 1985; McMinn et al., 1990; J. B. Parks & Roberton, 2004, 2008; Rubin et al., 1994; Sarrasin et al., 2012; Swim et al., 2004). I return to discussing the similarities between these two debates later in Section 0.8. While language attitudes certainly play a role, they do not explain all—or even, arguably, the majority—of variance in acceptability judgments about singular they. While the acceptability of generic, gender-unspecified forms of singular they was predicted by both linguistic prescriptivism and anti-trans prejudice, the acceptability of specific, gendered forms (e.g., coreferring with names) was primarily predicted by anti-trans prejudice (Hernandez, 2020).\nMany of the predictors of attitudes about singular they are highly correlated. For example, people who are younger are more likely to be exposed to singular they, to know a TGD person, and to have less conservative beliefs about gender and sexuality (Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019). It is still unclear whether age predicts attitudes towards singular they primarily by proxy through these other social factors, or if age-related differences in language learning and processing (DeDe & Knilans, 2016) are also at play. Some preliminary research has begun to try to tease these apart. Kramer et al. (2021), for example, argues that experience is a better predictor of using they/them pronouns correctly than age. Overall, the relationship between these predictors is still unclear and remains an area for future research."

    "title": "Introduction",
    "section": "0.4 Comprehension",
    "text": "0.4 Comprehension\nTurning to comprehension, research has examined both offline comprehension—asking people about their interpretation of a sentence after reading or listening to it—and online comprehension—using measures such as reading time or eye gaze to observe people’s interpretation of a sentence while reading or listening to it (Allopenna et al., 1998; Liversedge & Findlay, 2000; Tanenhaus et al., 1995, 2000). Most studies of reading use one of two paradigms. In self-paced reading tasks, participants press a button to advance through the text one phrase or word at a time, measuring how long they spend at each region. In eyetracking while reading tasks, participants’ eye movements are recorded while they read (relatively) naturalistically, measuring the sequence and duration of their saccades to (eye movements directed towards) and fixations on (gaze focused on) each word or phrase (Liversedge et al., 1998; Rayner & Juhasz, 2006). Generally, longer durations at and regressions back to a region are assumed to reflect having more difficulty understanding the text (Carpenter & Just, 1983; Henderson, 2013; Rayner, 1988). This is referred to as a processing cost or penalty. The following section is organized using the same three categories of singular they as Section 0.2.3: generic indefinite, specific definite gender-unspecified, and specific definite gender-specified (i.e., coreferring with proper names). But before discussing the existing research about comprehending singular they, I first review the prior research on gender agreement processing that it is based on.\n\n0.4.1 Processing Gender Agreement\nThe majority of studies about gender agreement have used stereotype mismatch tasks, classically illustrated with:\n\nExample 9 \nA man and his son were away for a trip. They were driving along the highway when they had a terrible accident. The man was killed outright but the son was alive, although badly injured. The son was rushed to the hospital and was to have an emergency operation. On entering the operating theatre, the surgeon looked at the boy, and said, “I can’t do this operation. This boy is my son.” How can this be? (Sanford, 1985)\n\nMany readers are confused by this story (see Morehouse et al. (2022) for a more recent overview). If, following the gender stereotype, the surgeon was assumed to be male, how could the boy’s father be both dead in the accident and working at the hospital? It takes time to come to the correct interpretation, that the surgeon is the boy’s mother. In the basic mismatch paradigm, participants read a sentence where a character is first referred to by a stereotypically-gendered role noun (usually a profession) and later referred to with a pronoun that matches or mismatches the stereotype. Stereotype-mismatching pronouns (e.g., surgeon…she) take longer to read than stereotype-matching pronouns (e.g., surgeon…he), suggesting that when readers had first encountered the new referent, they used gender stereotype information to make an inference about the referent’s gender (Kennison & Trofe, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2006). Upon reaching the mismatching pronoun, readers have to revise their interpretation, which incurs a processing cost. Alternatively, if a gender inference had not been made at the role noun, the process of making a gender inference at the pronoun would be the same regardless of stereotype match.\nConverging evidence is also available from event-related potential (ERP) data, which uses electrodes placed on the scalp to measure changes in the brain’s electrical field caused by neural activity (Samar, 2006). Stereotype-mismatching pronouns elicit a P600 effect: a positive wave in the centro-parietal regions, occurring 600–100ms after the word (Friederici, 2002). Some argue that the P600 indexes syntactic processing, and it can be observed when listeners encounter a syntactic error, a sentence with a complex syntactic structure, or new information that requires revising their interpretation of the sentence’s syntactic structure (Hagoort et al., 1993; Kaan et al., 2000; Osterhout et al., 1994; Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992). Like a longer reading time, a P600 is interpreted as indicating that the sentence’s syntactic structure is harder to understand. Notably, the P600 effect was still observed when participants judged the sentences with stereotype-mismatching pronouns to be acceptable (Osterhout et al., 1997; see Banaji & Hardin, 1996; Oakhill et al., 2005 for similar findings in a priming paradigm). Generally, the mismatch paradigm tends to remain agnostic about whether the mismatch effect arises more from gender stereotype beliefs or more from distributional knowledge. However, the fact that it occurs in the absence of negative metalinguistic judgments can be interpreted in favor of the gender mismatch being more due to statistical expectations in language processing (i.e., that surgeon occurs more frequently with he than she) than to higher-level beliefs about gender (i.e., that surgeons should be men).\nGrammatical gender languages provide stronger evidence for early, automatic inferences about the gender of referents when they are introduced into the discourse context. Carreiras et al. (1996) compared English results to Spanish, which marks gender on determiners and nouns. In English, the role noun provides stereotype information, and the referent’s gender is not specified until the pronoun; in Spanish, the referent’s gender is specified at the determiner:\n\nExample 10 \n1 The footballer wanted to play in the match.\n2 HeMASC/SheFEM had been training very hard during the week.\n\n\nExample 11 \n1 ElMASC futbolista/LaFEM futbolista quería jugar el partido.\n2 ElMASC/EllaFEM había estado entrenando mucho durante la semana.\n\nBecause the determiner is gender-marked in Spanish (Example 11), the referent’s gender is disambiguated from the beginning. English (Example 10) allows readers to make a guess about gender at the beginning using their knowledge about the gender-stereotyped role noun, but does not disambiguate the referent’s gender until the pronoun in the second sentence, making it possible to have an incorrect interpretation of the referent’s gender during the first sentence. Both English and Spanish showed a mismatch effect, where stereotype-mismatching sentences (footballer…she in 10) took longer to read than stereotype-matching sentences (footballer…he in 10), but it occurred at different points in the story. While English showed the mismatch effect at the pronoun (sentence 2 in 10), Spanish showed the mismatch effect at the role noun (sentence 1 in 11). This indicates that readers made inferences about the referent’s gender as soon as gender information became available, regardless of whether or not it was necessary for comprehension.\nAn alternative explanation to these results, at least in English, is that the gender stereotype of the role noun is only activated when the pronoun is read, not when the role noun first introduces the referent. Thus, the slowdown would come only from incongruent gender cues, not from needing to revise an initial interpretation. In Examples 10 and 11, this explanation would look like taking longer to process she coreferring with footballer because it does not match gender stereotype predictions, but not because the footballer had been interpreted as male in the prior sentence. To rule out this explanation, Garnham et al. (2002) tested the mismatch effect with two probabilistic cues about gender: role nouns and either gendered clothing or physical traits:\n\nExample 12 \n1 The housekeeper/soldier\n2 was rushed to the hospital, taken to a private ward, and\n3 gave birth half an hour later.\n\nHere, both the role noun and the verb are stereotypically gendered, compared to prior experiments that paired a stereotypically-gendered role noun with a definitionally-gendered pronoun.2 A mismatch effect will only occur if inferences about the referent’s gender are made at both the role noun (line 1 in 12) and at the stereotypically-gendered verb (line 3 in 12), not just at the verb. In other words, the soldier…gave birth would not take longer to read than the housekeeper…gave birth unless the reader had already inferred that the soldier was male before reaching gave birth. Results showed mismatch effects for reading time and acceptability judgment reaction times, which indicates that definitionally-gendered language is not necessary to assign a gender to referents. Instead, comprehenders use probabilistic information such as gender stereotype and distributional knowledge about role nouns to make an inference about the referent’s gender. This inference may be proven wrong after encountering further information, and needing to revise an interpretation of a referent who has been represented as (probably) one gender incurs a processing cost.\nAnother benefit of using grammatical gender languages to study agreement processing is that they allow grammatical and social gender cues to be manipulated separately, potentially providing conflicting information (Reali et al., 2015). Results from multiple languages suggest that stereotypical knowledge is activated independently from morphosyntactic cues (Molinaro et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2002). In addition to integrating potentially-conflicting gender cues, gender inferences need to be integrated with other cues about reference. Having the prior context indicate the gender of the referent eliminates the mismatch effect (Duffy & Keir, 2004; Kreiner et al., 2008):\n\nExample 13 \n1 Jeff’s/Lucy’s power had been unreliable ever since the tornado. The electrician was a cautious man/woman who carefully secured his/her ladder to the side of the house before checking the roof. Jeff/Lucy suspected that high winds had loosened the connection to the power lines.\n2 The electrician taught himself/herself a lot while fixing the problem.\n\nWhile the pronoun (herself) does mismatch the stereotypical role noun (electrician), it does not mismatch the interpretation supported by the preceding context (the electrician was a cautious woman). In stories like Example 13, herself does not take longer to read than himself, like it would if the second part were read in isolation. This does not imply that no difficulty integrating unexpected information happens, only that this process has already occurred before reaching the pronoun.\nGender information also interacts with broader discourse expectations. In English, pronouns are more likely to corefer with previously-mentioned names than upcoming new names. Participants took longer to reject gender-mismatching interpretations when a cue separate from gender—order of mention—supported the gender-mismatching interpretation (e.g., John…she) than when the order cue did not support the gender-mismatching interpretation either (e.g., she…John) (Kennison et al., 2009). Most of the studies discussed have presented stereotypical gender information when first introducing the referent, but stereotypical gender cues can also be used to revise prior interpretations made using other cues, such as order (Pyykkönen et al., 2010).\nEven when it is a highly salient cue, gender information is not necessarily applied symmetrically. One experiment in German, aiming to distinguish between grammatical gender and stereotypical gender cues, measured reading times for pronouns in passages that described stereotypically-gendered jobs without using the grammatically-gendered role noun itself:\n\nExample 14 \nOriginal: L.K. vereinbart Termine, erledigt die Korrespondenz in einem Büro. Außerdem kann er eine fremde Sprache.\nTranslated, maintaining the German word order: L.K. makes appointments, deals with the correspondence in an office. In addition speaks he a foreign language.\n\nThe mismatch effects for masculine pronouns coreferring with feminine jobs and for feminine pronouns coreferring with masculine jobs were different. In examples such as 14, masculine pronouns in a feminine context caused readers to look at the masculine pronoun for longer and to be more likely to look back at it, indicating that the gender mismatch effect occurred during both early and late stages of processing. In contrast, feminine pronouns in masculine contexts did elicit a mismatch effect, but only during late stages of processing. While female referents were interpreted to be compatible with both masculine and feminine contexts, male referents were only compatible with masculine contexts (Reali et al., 2015). This suggests that in the absence of definitive grammatical cues, gender stereotype information is interpreted more flexibly for women than men. Similarly, a priming task showed a slower reaction time for feminine-stereotyped role nouns followed by masculine pronouns, but no parallel effect for masculine-stereotyped role nouns followed by feminine pronouns (Cacciari & Padovani, 2007). This asymmetry likely reflects that changes in gender norms over the last 50 years have consisted more of women being able to do masculine things than men being able to do feminine things.\nFinally, in some contexts comprehenders interpret gender-mismatched pronouns as referring to an unknown, upcoming referent, instead of trying to establish coreference with a referent that does not agree in gender. Hearing pronouns that mismatched definitionally-gendered antecedents (e.g., aunt…he) elicited an Nref ERP response—a negative, left-frontal shift starting 300ms after the pronoun and continuing for the rest of the sentence (Nieuwland, 2014). The authors argue this indexes a high degree of referential ambiguity, where the listener fails to match the pronoun to a referent. In this example, the Nref occurs if the listener assumes that because aunt and he mismatch in gender, he refers to someone not mentioned yet.\n\n\n0.4.2 Generic Indefinite Singular They\nThe studies discussed so far show that comprehenders automatically3 and rapidly make inferences about gender when a new referent is mentioned—even when gender is irrelevant for comprehension—and that revising these gender inferences incurs processing costs. Turning to singular they, the earliest published data compared the processing cost incurred by generic indefinite singular they to those incurred by stereotype-mismatching he and she (Foertsch & Gernsbacher, 1997). Participants read “should” statements using an indefinite antecedent and a pronoun, then decided whether or not they agreed:\n\nExample 15 \n1 A nurse should have an understanding of how a medication works\n2 even if he/she/they will not have any say in prescribing it\n3 because nurses must anticipate how a patient will respond to the medication.\n\n\nThe dependent measure was the time spent reading the clause including the pronoun (line 2 in 15). There were four types of indefinite antecedents: stereotypically-masculine nouns, stereotypically-feminine nouns, gender-neutral nouns, and indefinite pronouns (e.g., everyone, someone); the four antecedents were crossed by three pronouns: he, she, and they. For gender-stereotyped antecedents, clauses with singular they were read more quickly than clauses with stereotype-mismatching pronouns and at the same speed as clauses with stereotype-matching pronouns. For gender-neutral antecedents, clauses with singular they were read at the same speed as clauses with he or she. For indefinite pronoun antecedents, clauses with singular they were read more quickly than clauses with he or she. The authors concluded that generic indefinite they was not more difficult to process than generic he, and in fact may be easier in some contexts.\nAn alternative baseline is a context where a plural mismatch effect is definitely expected. Instead of testing whether reading singular they is slower than he or she with singular antecedents like Foertsch & Gernsbacher (1997), Sanford & Filik (2007) tested if singular they retains the same plural mismatch effect as he and she with plural referents. Participants read sentences that included either a gender-unspecified indefinite antecedent (e.g., a person, someone) or a plural antecedent (e.g., some people), then either a singular pronoun (him/her) or a plural pronoun (they). This experiment employed an eyetracking while reading paradigm, which provides a more sensitive measure of processing disruptions than self-paced reading. The analysis included measures of early processing, including go-past reading time, which is the total time spent looking at the critical region when first encountering it; and measures of later processing, including total reading time, which is the total time spent looking at the critical region the first time and any times returning to it. Early processing measures showed a plural mismatch effect for him/her (e.g., some people…him &gt; a person…him), but not for their (e.g., a person…their ≈ some people…their). The later processing measure showed plural mismatch effects for both him/her and their. However, the processing cost for singular they was small—only around 100ms. The authors interpret this to mean that singular pronouns show an earlier sensitivity to number mismatches than plural pronouns, but that when a mismatch is detected for singular they, it is easily accommodated.\n\n\n0.4.3 Definite Singular They\nThe early studies about comprehension of indefinite singular they by Foertsch & Gernsbacher (1997) also tested specific definite forms, using similar “should” statements, e.g., 15 with my nurse instead of a nurse. For masculine- and feminine-stereotyped antecedents, clauses with singular they showed intermediate reading times: faster than clauses with stereotype-mismatching pronouns, but slower than clauses with stereotype-matching pronouns. For gender-neutral antecedents, there was no difference between singular they and he/she. Across antecedent definiteness and gender stereotypicality, singular they only showed a penalty for definite, gender-stereotyped referents. Observing a processing cost for gender-stereotyped but not gender-neutral referents suggests that slower processing for definite specific singular they may be due more to expectations about when a speaker should know and mark the referent’s gender, not necessarily due to number agreement (Foertsch & Gernsbacher, 1997).\nA later study investigated reader’s expectations about gender more directly (Doherty & Conklin, 2017). Participants read short stories that included a pronoun referring to a definitionally-gendered antecedent (“gender-known” condition, e.g., spokeswoman), a stereotypically-gendered antecedent (“high-expectancy” condition, e.g., mechanic), or a gender-neutral antecedent (“low-expectancy” condition, e.g., cyclist):\n\nExample 16 \n1 Adam recently had an accident in his car.\n2 He was emerging from a junction when he hit a cyclist and\n3 knocked him/her/them\n4 straight\n5 off the bike.\n6 Fortunately, the cyclist was not badly hurt.\n\nParticipants’ eye movements were analyzed over three regions at and immediately after the pronoun. For gender-neutral antecedents, singular they was not read faster or slower than he/she. For stereotypically-gendered and definitionally-gendered antecedents, singular they did show costs, and critically, these patterns were different between the two antecedent types. At the verb + pronoun region (line 3 in 16), singular they patterned with the gender-matching pronoun for definitionally-gendered antecedents (e.g., spokeswoman…they ≈ spokeswoman…she) but with the gender-mismatching pronoun for stereotypically-gendered antecedents (e.g., mechanic…they ≈ mechanic…she). At the adverb following the pronoun (line 4 in 16), singular they was not faster or slower compared to gender-matching he/she for either antecedent type. At the final region (line 5 in 16), singular they showed a cost compared to the gender-matching pronoun for definitionally-gendered, but not stereotypically-gendered antecedents. This is the reverse of the pattern seen at the verb + pronoun region, but now in the expected direction. However, Doherty & Conklin note that the cost of singular they is much more transient and less robust than the cost of a gender mismatch (e.g., spokeswoman…he). The fact that stereotypically-gendered and definitionally-gendered antecedents behaved differently, both in the eyetracking data and in the acceptability judgment task that was used to pilot the stimuli, is evidence for probabilistic gender expectations in discourse processing. In a later study, late-intermediate and advanced learners of English showed similar patterns of reading times, adding further evidence indicating that late acquisition of singular they is feasible (Speyer & Schleef, 2019).\n\n\n0.4.4 Singular They Coreferring with Proper Names\nThe findings so far show that when singular they refers to a specific definite—but gender-unspecified—referent, it does incur a processing cost, but one that is easily accommodated. The few studies about they coreferring with proper names (specific definite and gender-specified) also show a processing cost, but the magnitude and cause are still unclear. Early self-paced reading results have been inconclusive (Ackerman, 2018a, 2018b, 2020). An ERP study on people who used they/them pronouns for themselves or someone close to them—and thus were highly familiar with specific, gender-specified they—yielded mixed results (Prasad & Morris, 2020). Participants showed no P600 effects, which index agreement and syntactic violations, for themselves coreferring with specific indefinite (e.g., someone) and specific definite gender-unspecified (e.g., the participant) referents, but did show P600 effects for specific definite gender-specified referents (e.g., proper names).\nMore recent preliminary findings showed that they coreferring with proper names elicited a P600 effect like gender-mismatching he and she (e.g., Mary…he), but only mismatching he and she elicited an Nref effect. This suggests that singular they is causing some degree of grammatical processing difficulty for listeners, but that it is not causing referential failure like strong gender mismatches (Chen et al., 2023). A related study used a maze task, which presents participants with a sentence one word at a time, and at each word, they have to pick which of two words could continue the sentence grammatically. At the critical location, participants have to decide between a pronoun (he, she, plural they, or singular they) and a different part of speech that is not grammatical at that location, e.g., Mary watched TV before bed because [they or liked], where a pronoun but not a verb can follow because. Participants were slower to decide that singular they could continue the sentence compared to gender-matching he/she, but not as slow as with gender-mismatching he/she (e.g., Mary…she &lt; Mary…they &lt; Mary…he) (Shenkar et al., 2023).\nFinally, two sets of studies have investigated how comprehenders use discourse context to understand singular they, one using an offline comprehension question and one using mouse tracking. In the offline comprehension task (Arnold et al., 2021), participants learned about three characters (1 he/him, 1 she/her, and 1 they/them), then read two-sentence stories with comprehension questions probing which character(s) they interpreted the pronoun as referring to. In the training phase, participants read stories with only one character, which strongly supported interpreting they as singular, e.g., 17. In addition to seeing the character’s pronouns modeled in the stories, some participants were given more direct information, e.g., Alex uses they/them pronouns. The majority of participants endorsed the singular interpretation (Alex is the one who fell down) during the training phase, and only participants who interpreted they as singular in all training trials were included in the primary analysis. After confirming that participants understood that the character uses they/them pronouns, the test phase investigated how they was interpreted in stories with two characters, where they could plausibly be singular or plural, e.g., 18.\n\nExample 17 \n1-character context:\n“Alex went running. They fell down.” Who fell down?\n\n\nExample 18 \n2-character context, named first:\n“Alex went running with Liz. They fell down.” Who fell down?\n\n\nExample 19 \n2-character context, named second:\n“Liz went running with Alex. They fell down.” Who fell down?\n\nTwo factors increased the proportion of singular interpretations: direct information and discourse context. Among participants who had always chosen the singular interpretation in the one-character training trials, participants who had also been directly told that the character uses they/them pronouns were more likely to choose the singular interpretation in the two-character context. This demonstrates that people can learn about someone’s pronouns and use that information to disambiguate singular from plural they. Participants were also more likely to choose the singular interpretation when the they/them character was named first (18) than when the they/them character was named second (19), which replicates prior findings for when he or she is ambiguous between two referents (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017; Gernsbacher, 1989) (see Section 4.1).\nIn the online comprehension task (Arnold et al., 2023), participants listened to stories about pairs of the characters interacting with objects:\n\nExample 20 \nLiz and Alex were cleaning up after a dinner party. Liz handed a towel to Alex. Then they dried the plates.\n\nIn the screen corresponding to 20, Liz is pictured with pots and pans, Alex is pictured with plates and silverware, and Alex and Liz together are pictured with cups and bowls. The participants’ task was to click on the objects that the character in the final sentence was using, and their reaction time and the number of times their mouse movement changed direction horizontally (i.e., moving back and forth between options) were recorded. If participants understand that they is singular and refers to Alex, they would be able to anticipate which object to click on and respond faster after hearing plates. Unsurprisingly, participants were slower to click on the image for stories using singular they than he and she. However, the degree of processing cost was modulated by discourse context, like in the offline comprehension task. When the they/them character was mentioned first and was thus more likely to be the antecedent of the pronoun, the number of mouse direction shifts was not increased compared to he and she. The authors interpret this to mean that when the discourse context supports interpreting they as singular, listeners still understand it a bit more slowly, but are not experiencing additional competition between the singular and plural interpretations (i.e., moving their mouse between the images for Alex and Alex & Liz). These two experiments provide further evidence that any processing costs for gender-specified singular they are manageable for comprehenders. Moreover, demonstrating that the character being named first instead of second supports comprehending they as singular suggests that people are using similar cues to disambiguate between singular and plural they as when other pronouns are ambiguous. If this is the case, it points to successful integration of singular they into existing reference resolution mechanisms, instead of treating it as an exception."

    "section": "0.5 Production",
    "text": "0.5 Production\nOne line of research about the production of singular they situates it in sociolinguistic theories of politeness. Conrod (2019b) argues that gendered pronouns function much like honorific markers, reflecting and negotiating a social relationship, as opposed to encoding a static grammatical feature or making a claim about some biological reality. Singular they introduces additional options for speakers—including the gender-unspecified form for people who use he/him or she/her—and so the choice between these options carries information. Speakers can take a variety of approaches to this decision. Someone may prioritize quantity (including enough information) over relevance and quality (including only relevant and accurate information) (Grice, 1975). In this case, the speaker could choose to be as specific as possible and use he or she, even when gender information is not relevant, or their use of he or she may be incorrect (e.g., the exchange in Example 5). If, on the other hand, the speaker prioritizes relevance over quantity, they could choose to be more vague and use they, even if they could include information about the person’s gender. Similarly, if a speaker prioritizes quality over quantity, they could choose to use they when the person’s gender is unknown, instead of making an inference about whether he or she would be correct (e.g., the exchange in Example 4).\nIn addition to communicating information, conversations are also building social relationships. The politeness theory framework proposes that people need to maintain both positive face (being liked and confident) and negative face (being free from obligations and impositions), and what they say can either maintain or threaten their face (Brown & Levinson, 1987). Conrod (2019b) describes several face constraints for gendered pronouns: (1) don’t ungender, because not specifying gender is an imposition on someone’s positive face; (2) don’t misgender, because specifying the wrong gender is an imposition on someone’s positive face; and (3) don’t correct me, because telling someone which pronouns to use is an imposition on their negative face. When a speaker does not know which pronouns to use, they can choose to prioritize (1) by making a guess, or to prioritize (2) by using gender-unspecified they or by avoiding pronouns. Much of the debate around pronouns is a conflict between (2) and (3), where people argue that correcting someone threatens face more than misgendering someone. Examples of this reasoning are discussed later in Section 0.8. Finally, choosing pronouns involves taking an affective and evaluative stance about both the person you are speaking about and the person you are speaking to (Du Bois, 2007). This stance-taking may be more overt, such as when speakers intentionally misgender someone to express disapproval and disagreement, or more subtle, such as when speakers leave gender unspecified to imply social distance (e.g., Conrod, 2019a).\nOnly a few experiments have tested language production. Generally, their preliminary findings indicate that speakers can produce specific definite singular they in both writing (Kramer et al., 2021) and speech (Arnold, Venkatesh, et al., 2022), especially when shown examples of the person being referred to with they/them. Production appears to cluster into the same three patterns as acceptability judgments (Camilliere et al., 2021; Konnelly & Cowper, 2020), with participants either not using singular they at all, using it only for referents introduced by last name (such that gender was unspecified), or using it for referents introduced with last names or first names (such that gender was inferrable) (Kaiser & Post, 2023).\nIn addition to how speakers can learn to produce they/them pronouns for a person instead of he/him or she/her, another open question is how speakers integrate singular they into their production system when deciding to use a pronoun instead of a different type of referring expression. Since pronouns are the most reduced forms compared to proper names and noun phrases, speakers only tend to use pronouns when the referent is highly salient, in focus, or accessible. In other words, speakers tend to choose the option that includes the least information if they think the comprehender already has enough information to identify the referent (Arnold & Zerkle, 2019). The counter-argument to singular they being too ambiguous to understand is that standard pronouns like he, she, and plural they frequently have the potential to be ambiguous. Speakers already have strategies to avoid too much ambiguity, and comprehenders already have strategies to interpret ambiguous pronouns. If specific singular they is being successfully integrated into our language use, then speakers will use or adapt existing strategies to minimize ambiguity. In a corpus study of news articles about nonbinary people who use they/them pronouns, writers were less likely to use pronouns overall for people who use they/them compared to people who use he/him or she/her. However, this difference was not explained by potential ambiguity, which the authors interpret to mean that writers may have been avoiding pronouns that were unfamiliar for them or their intended readers, not that a referent using they/them created contexts where a pronoun would have been uniquely ambiguous (Arnold, Marquez, et al., 2022). In a speech production study, participants were less likely to use a pronoun to continue a story that had introduced two characters than a story that had introduced only one character. Instead, people were more likely to use a name in this context since a pronoun could refer to two possible referents. However, pronoun use was reduced to the same degree for they compared to he and she, again suggesting that singular they does not introduce a unique level of ambiguity (Arnold, Venkatesh, et al., 2022)."

    "text": "0.6 Frequency\nAs society has become more accepting of LGBTQ+ identities, the TGD community in the United States has grown in both size and visibility. A meta-analysis of population-based, probability samples from 2006–2016 estimated that 1 in 250 U.S. adults are transgender (Meerwijk & Sevelius, 2017). In 2014, the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey—a representative, probability-based survey about the health behaviors and conditions of U.S. adults—added a set of demographic questions about sexuality and gender, which around 30 states now include. An average of 1 in 200 people have said they considered themself transgender (CDC, 2014, 2015; analyzed in Crissman et al., 2017; Herman et al., 2022), with the rate rising to 1 in 128 in the most recent survey (CDC, 2021). The TGD community skews younger, even more so than the broader LGBTQ+ community (Harrison et al., 2012; Herman et al., 2022; James et al., 2016; Streed Jr. et al., 2017). While the sample sizes of population-based surveys of teens are smaller than those of adults, a larger proportion of U.S. teens identify as4 transgender—between 1 in 50 and 1 in 75 (CDC, 2019; Eisenberg et al., 2017; Herman et al., 2022; Kidd et al., 2021; Perez-Brumer et al., 2017; Shields et al., 2013; Twenge, 2023).\nAn increasing proportion of the transgender community is nonbinary: In 2014, 17% of transgender respondents in the CDC BRFSS survey did not identify as men or women; in 2021, this increased to 33% (CDC, 2014, 2021; similar or higher rates in Grant et al., 2011; Harrison et al., 2012; James et al., 2016; C. Parks et al., 2023; UK Government Equalities Office, 2018; Wilson & Meyer, 2021). The majority of the population-based surveys discussed so far ask if the person identifies as transgender, and then if so, if they are a man, a woman, or gender-nonconforming/something else. Since not all nonbinary people also identify as trans, the size of the broader TGD community is likely still underestimated (James et al., 2016; Meerwijk & Sevelius, 2017; Wilson & Meyer, 2021). The U.S. Household Pulse survey, which asks American adults every few weeks about employment, living, and health conditions, added a survey question about gender in 2021. The response options include male, female, transgender, and none of these. While this is not the ideal way of asking about gender (NASEM, 2022), the data set is large enough that it is able to start correcting for the under-count of nonbinary people. Rates of nonbinary identity are increasing particularly for Gen Z adults (ages 18–26 in 2021 and 2022): 2.3% identify as trans and 3.3% as “none of these.” To put this into perspective, out of the 39 million Gen Z adults in the U.S., about 2 million are trans and/or nonbinary, which is more than the population of Phoenix, AZ—the fifth-largest city (Twenge, 2023). Analyzing changes in the Household Pulse survey over the past few years, Twenge argues that Gen Z represents a massive, ongoing generational shift in views about gender (2023).\nWhile the changes are largest in younger generations, support for and familiarity with TGD people has been growing across generational, political, and religious groups. Currently, 40% of U.S. adults know a trans person and 16% know a nonbinary person, and the proportion who have a trans family member or close friend has more than doubled from 11% in 2011 to 24% in 2019 (Jones et al., 2019; Minkin & Brown, 2021; PRRI, 2021). The majority (70%) say they would be somewhat or very comfortable learning that a friend, coworker, or community member was trans, and a slim majority (55%) say the same for their child (PRRI, 2021). On average, 60% of adults said they became more supportive of transgender rights between 2012 and 2019, compared to 25% who said they became less supportive. 40% said that trans people face “a lot of stigma or negative social judgment in their community” (Jones et al., 2019). Among young adults specifically (ages 15–24), the majority (80%) said that there is a lot of discrimination against trans people, and only 12% perceived it as decreasing during 2017 (Jones et al., 2018).\nWithin the growing TGD community, around 80% of nonbinary people and 50% of trans people say that they use they/them pronouns (Cassian, 2021, 2022; Cheung et al., 2020; C. Parks et al., 2023). This corresponds to rapid increases in familiarity with singular they in recent years: Around 70% of people under 40, 60% of people 40–55, and just under 50% of people 55+ say they have heard a little or a lot about “people preferring that others use gender-neutral pronouns such as they instead of he or she when referring to them” (Parker et al., 2019). 46% of people ages 18–29, 29% of people 30–49, 18% of people 50–64, and 11% of people 65+ personally know someone who prefers gender-neutral pronouns in 2021, up from 8–32% in 2018.5 Correspondingly, about 60% of people 18–29, 50% of people 30–64, and 40% of people 65+ say they would be somewhat or very comfortable using gender-neutral pronouns—which would most likely be singular they—for someone who asked. Political affiliation is a stronger predictor than age here, with 40% of Democrats saying they would be very comfortable and 40% of Republicans saying they would be very uncomfortable (Minkin & Brown, 2021). Compared to gender-neutral pronoun use, U.S. adults are more divided about the concept of the gender binary, with 40% saying they somewhat or strongly believe there are a range of genders and 60% saying they somewhat or strongly believe there are only two (Jones et al., 2019; PRRI, 2021; Twenge, 2023)."

Recent work has contextualized these experiences in the minority stress framework, where health disparities in a marginalized group arise from the array of stressors caused by societal stigma against them (Chodzen et al., 2019; Howe, 2019; Lindley & Galupo, 2020; Puckett et al., 2020; Rood et al., 2016; Tebbe & Moradi, 2016; Testa et al., 2015; Valentine & Shipherd, 2018; White Hughto et al., 2015).\nMisgendering—where someone is referred to using gendered language that does not match their identity—is a commonly reported minority stressor affecting the TGD community. TGD people describe being misgendered as alienating, devaluing, invalidating, and painful (Cordoba, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2019; Gunn, 2020; Johnson, 2019; Pitcher, 2017; Saltzburg & Davis, 2010; Truszczynski et al., 2020). This is because the language we use to refer to ourselves—names, pronouns, kinship roles, community affiliations—creates and reflects parts of our identity:\n\nIf, as posited by social constructionism, language constitutes and creates the meaning of our lives, then not having language to fit how [genderqueer youth] view themselves leaves them feeling outside of and “not counted” in the human experience…It seems that in trying to fit gender variant young people into a languaged existence that does not correspond to how they view themselves, society deprives them of sense of self, self-value, and a recognized social existence.\n— Saltzburg & Davis (2010)\n\nAs a consequence of having their identities forgotten, contested, or overwritten, people who are misgendered more frequently show higher rates of depression, stress, suicidality, disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (Galupo et al., 2020; McLemore, 2015, 2018; Mitchell et al., 2021; The Trevor Project, 2020). Using gender-affirming pronouns, names, and body terms is particularly important in healthcare contexts, as it forms a key part of how positive or negative the experience is for TGD patients (Baldwin et al., 2018).\nNonbinary TGD people are misgendered frequently: only 1 in 10 nonbinary youth report all or most people respecting their pronouns (The Trevor Project, 2020), and 2 in 3 nonbinary people did not ask for correct pronouns at work to avoid discrimination (James et al., 2016). Additionally, some studies report that getting people to use new pronouns is more difficult than getting people to use a new name (Barbee & Schrock, 2019). While most studies about misgendering report participants’ genders, but not the gendered language they use, the fact that a large proportion of nonbinary people use they/them pronouns (Cassian, 2021, 2022; Cheung et al., 2020; C. Parks et al., 2023)—combined with the relative newness of specific singular they—means we can infer that people who use they/them pronouns are likely misgendered regularly.\nUsing they/them pronouns often places TGD people in a double bind, where they are forced to choose between experiencing more discrimination by openly identifying as TGD, or between getting misgendered. For example, when searching for jobs, the majority of nonbinary people said that identifying themselves as nonbinary to a potential employer would hurt their job search somewhat (60%) or very much (25%). These expectations were confirmed by an experiment that measured how adding they/them pronouns to a resume affected application outcomes. The otherwise-identical resume received 9% more interest, and when asked directly about their impressions, hiring managers rated the applicant with a resume including they/them pronouns as 7% less qualified and were 4% less likely to invite them for an additional interview (McGonagill, 2023).\nMisgendering is a form of microaggression (Chang & Chung, 2015; Nadal et al., 2014, 2016; Nadal, 2019). In the original microaggression framework, developed to describe experiences with racism, microaggressions fall into three categories: microinsults, which carry subtle or implied snubs (i.e., that the speaker did not expect the person to be as competent as they are); microassaults, which insult someone through name-calling or avoidant behavior; and microinvalidations, which deny the experience, beliefs, or emotions of the person (i.e., “but I don’t see color” as negating someone’s experience of how their race affects how they are treated) (Sue et al., 2007). Intentional misgendering—where someone deliberately uses the wrong name or pronouns to insult someone or deny the legitimacy of their identity—would fall under the category of microassaults (Conrod, 2019a; Nadal, 2013). Unintentional misgendering—where someone uses the wrong name or pronouns because of an incorrect inference about someone they don’t know (i.e., that all people they perceive as feminine use she/her) or because of a speech error after someone changes names or pronouns—would fall more under the category of microinvalidations (Gunn, 2020; McLemore, 2015). The key idea of the microaggressions framework is that while many individual events may be minor or perpetrated unintentionally, the toll of experiencing them frequently is substantial and cumulative. Nonbinary people described their reactions to being misgendered using similar distinctions as the microaggressions framework, where both the perceived intent and the proximity of the speaker mattered (Cordoba, 2020). Being misgendered by people they were close to was interpreted as more intentional and experienced as more hurtful. While being misgendered by acquaintances or strangers was interpreted as less intentional and hurt less, these negative experiences accumulate constantly. One genderqueer person described their experience as:\n\nBut sometimes it just feels like a thousand paper cuts. And you know, by the end of the day you’re like, “how many times has someone misgendered me today?” It’s really difficult to speak about someone without using a pronoun, particularly when you’re not aware that’s a problem. And so, sometimes by the end of the day you just feel like, you’ve just been rubbed raw and you’re like, “How many billions of times did someone refer to me as she and Ms. today?”\n— interviewed in Cordoba (2020)\n\nOther work has described how social support can mitigate the negative mental health effects of misgendering and other transphobic microaggressions (Bockting et al., 2013; McLemore, 2015; Penklis, 2020; Puckett et al., 2019; Testa et al., 2015; The Trevor Project, 2020; Veale, Peter, et al., 2017; Weinhardt et al., 2019). Little research, however, has focused on preventative strategies. Reducing how often TGD people are misgendered is one avenue for ameliorating disparities in mental health."

    "text": "0.8 Sociopolitical Context\nLike other language innovations in the LGBTQ+ community, singular they evokes overt hostility about nonbinary and transgender identities, language change, and people’s right to determine how they are referred to. More broadly, misgendering and language reform have become a prominent topic in the “political correctness” and “wokeness” wars. A Wall Street Journal op-ed by journalist and political speechwriter Peggy Noonan expresses the major themes of opposition:\n\nI’ve been thinking about the language and behavioral directives that have been coming at us from the social and sexual justice warriors who are renaming things and attempting to control the language in America. In one way it’s the nonsense we’ve all grown used to, but it should be said that there’s an aspect of self-infatuation, of arrogance, in telling people they must reorder the common language to suit your ideological preferences. There is something mad in thinking you should control the names of things…Offices and schools are forced to grapple with all the new gender-neutral pronouns…Use “they” a lot. It’s gender neutral…This is grammatically incorrect but so what? Correct grammar, and the intelligibility it allows, is a small price to pay for inclusion and equality. We are being asked to memorize all this, to change hundreds of years of grammar and usage, to accommodate the needs or demands of a group that perceives itself as beleaguered.\n— “What were Robespierre’s Pronouns?” (2019)\n\nOn its face, the opposition to singular they is about grammatical correctness and clarity, presuming that English grammar exists in some pure form which must be guarded and preserved. While some people claim that “correct” grammar cannot change, others argue that change is simply too difficult a request. For people like Noonan, the costs of changing language use are massive, and the costs of misgendering others are grossly exaggerated.6 Arguments about grammar frequently mask arguments about gender: are nonbinary identities real and important enough to warrant consideration in our language use? Noonan implies that they are not when she dismisses TGD people as “a group that perceives itself as beleaguered.” Former academic social psychologist turned conservative influencer Jordan Peterson is more overt about opposing TGD identities more than he supports traditional grammar:\n\nI don’t recognize another person’s right to decide what words I’m going to use, especially when the words they want me to use, first of all, are non-standard elements of the English language and they are constructs of a small coterie of ideologically motivated people. They might have a point but I’m not going to say their words for them…There’s not enough evidence to make the case that gender identity and biological sexuality are independently varying constructs. I don’t believe that it’s reasonable for our society to undermine the entire concept of binary gender in order to hypothetically accommodate a tiny minority of people.\n— “I’m not a bigot” Meet the U of T prof who refuses to use genderless pronouns (2016)\n\nI have already presented population data showing that the TGD community is not so tiny of a minority that they are not, practically speaking, worth consideration (Section 0.6). More importantly, the clinical evidence shows that misgendering causes harm (Section 0.7). One of the premises of this dissertation is that getting someone’s pronouns right is not a unique or unreasonable demand. Instead, I place pronouns in the same category as names and titles, where we generally do agree that people get to “decide what words [other people] are going to use.” In some cases, it may be linguistically difficult, like how someone’s name may be hard to pronounce for non-native speakers, but doing our best to get it right is part of being polite.\nWhile the debate about singular they and nonbinary identities is relatively recent, the broader debate about gendered language, sociopolitical influences on language, and the standards of correct speech has been happening for centuries (Bodine, 1975). The following 1880 complaint about generic they as an alternative to generic he bears striking similarity to Noonan’s complaints about singular they:\n\nTheir is very commonly misused with reference to a singular noun. Even John Ruskin has written such a sentence as this: “But if a customer wishes you to injure their foot or to disfigure it, you are to refuse their pleasure.” How Mr. Ruskin could have written such a sentence as that (for plainly there is no slip of the pen or result of imperfect interlinear correction in it), or how, it having been written, it could be passed by an intelligent proof-reader, I cannot surmise. It is, perhaps, an exemplification of the straits to which we are driven by the lack of a pronoun of common gender meaning both he and she, his and her. But, admitting this lack, the fact remains that his is the representative pronoun, as mankind includes both men and women.\n— Everyday English (1880)\n\nComplaints about singular they and he or she as alternatives to generic he were essentially the same: they were argued to be grammatically incorrect and unclear, despite common usage (Bodine, 1975). More critically, non-sexist language reform was considered unnecessary (Blaubergs, 1980; Martyna, 1980; J. B. Parks & Roberton, 1998). Women’s opposition to using generic masculine language was trivial and unreasonable, a statement that is far more political than linguistic (Ehrlich & King, 1992; Penelope, 1982). In each of these arguments, the underlying assumption is that the status quo and defense of it is not ideologically motivated, but support for language change is.\nThis dissertation takes it for granted that people asking to have their identities respected and to not be misgendered is not, as the subtitle of Noonan’s essay claims, “the work of sociopaths who politicize language” (2019). Unfortunately, pronouns have become an overt symbol of whether or not you acknowledge that trans and gender diverse people exist, with “using pronouns” escalating from a dog whistle to one of the focuses of current anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. 2023 has already seen a record number of bills introduced in U.S. state legislatures targeting transgender rights (HRC, 2023). Many of these bills include policies about misgendering—alongside more extreme policies such as outlawing all gender-affirming medical care (ACLU, 2023). The majority of the current bills focus on public school contexts and minors. Multiple states have successfully banned (TN S.B. 0466/H.B. 1269, 2023) or attempted to ban (AZ S.B. 1001, 2022; IN H.B. 1346, 2023; ND S.B. 2231, 2023) public schools from requiring that employees refer to a student using pronouns different than he/him or she/her corresponding to the student’s sex assigned at birth.7 The proposed legislation frequently moves beyond banning consequences for misgendering to banning the promotion of not misgendering (IN H.B. 1346, 2023). For example, one Oklahoma bill bans “creating, enforcing, or endorsing a policy that respects, favors, endorses, or promotes non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy.” This includes “mandating non-obvious pronoun changes that respect gender identity ideology and sexual orientation orthodoxy” because these are “naked assertions that are implicitly religious and have a tendency to erode community standards of decency and promote licentiousness” (OK S.B. 937, 2023).8\nThe prohibition of promoting not misgendering often moves to creating consequences for not misgendering. In most variations of this bill, school employees would not be allowed to use a student’s chosen pronouns unless the school has written permission from a parent (AZ S.B. 1001, 2022; IN H.B. 1346, 2023; S.B. 2231, 2023; ND S.B. 2260, 2023; NH H.B. 619, 2023; OK S.B. 30, 2022),9 as well as medical documentation for diagnosed gender dysphoria (IN H.B. 1346, 2023). This would make it difficult for TGD students to be out at school without proactive support from a parent, which many teenagers do not have (Baum et al., 2012; The Trevor Project, 2020, 2022). Instead, school employees would be legally required to notify parents if student uses “expresses or indicates a desire to change…(A) name; (B) attire; or (C) pronoun, title or word to identify the student; in a manner that is inconsistent with the student’s biological sex assigned at birth” (IN S.B. 354, 2023).10 In 2022, only half of TGD youth said their school was supportive, but only a third said their home was supportive (The Trevor Project, 2022). This indicates that while schools are not supportive enough overall, they are still an environment where many TGD youth receive support that they are not otherwise receiving at home—a possibility that the current legislation aims to remove.\nAnti-LGBTQ legislation also targets education more broadly, not just policies about specific transgender students. Schools would not be allowed to provide instruction “recognizing expressed gender” in classrooms or in professional development (ND S.B. 2231, 2023), or to teach “different pronouns other than those in common use in the English language when referring to the male or female” (NH H.B. 619, 2023). Books that “promote gender fluidity or gender pronouns” would be in the category of books that parents could report and have removed from schools (AZ S.B. 1700, 2023).11\nWhy talk about pronouns now? Given how legal protections and healthcare access are being eroded in the U.S., misgendering is far from the most immediate or severe hardship facing trans and gender diverse people. A similar argument was made in the non-sexist language debates (Blaubergs, 1980; J. B. Parks & Roberton, 1998), and probably comes up in every language reform effort. Claiming that misgendering is worth addressing is not claiming that language is the worst problem, and a form of injustice does not need to be one of the most severe to be worth fighting. Much as we might like to ignore gendered language in favor of other, bigger problems—or at least people who aren’t linguists might like to think less about language—English does not give us the option of ignoring it. Because Standard English requires us to encode gender in many of the pronouns, titles, and other terms we use to refer to people, gender is part of “thinking for speaking” (Slobin, 1996), where we have to think about and assert gender even in contexts where we might otherwise prefer not to. In the words of one genderqueer trans person:\n\nI think gender becomes very prominent when you are constantly being misgendered, and living with dysphoria. I don’t necessarily want it to be important, but it is in the way I guess an injury is important, in that you have to be careful with it, pay it more mind than a non-injured part…I really wish it didn’t have to be, wish it wasn’t enshrined in our language that people’s gender is the most important thing and the first thing we need to know, even for a casual “hello.” — interviewed in Cordoba (2020)\n\nA second reason that misgendering is important to address now is that it is a tractable and winnable problem. The debates about misgendering are headed by a small but vocal minority. As I discussed in Section 0.6, the majority of people are supportive and open to learning. Critically, misgendering is one aspect that individual allies have the ability to concretely affect. While most people cannot, for example, change healthcare policy in their state, they can change their own language and the norms of their communities, making their environments more welcoming to the trans and gender diverse people in their communities. Singular they is a case where linguistics and cognitive psychology have relevant expertise and an opportunity to contribute to socially relevant research.\n\n\n\n\nAbbott, B. (2006).

    "text": "See Bjorkman (2017) and Konnelly & Cowper (2020) for a discussion of how proper names may have morphosyntactic gender features used to evaluate agreement with pronouns, a question that this dissertation remains agnostic about.↩︎\nArguably, pronouns are not definitionally gendered, since not all people who use she/her are women and not all women use she/her, and vice versa for men and he/him. However, treating pronouns as probabilistic cues—nearly all people who use she/her are women and nearly all women use she/her—would make the same predictions. Even if it is not a binary rule, the pronoun would still be a stronger cue about gender than the stereotypes associated with a role noun.↩︎\nI make a distinction between our higher-level beliefs about gender and our lower-level, automatic cognitive processing. The fact that comprehenders immediately infer a gender categorization for new referents reflects statistical knowledge about how language is used, but does not necessarily reflect a belief in gender as binary and transparent. For a theory of how automatic categorization processes interact with higher-level beliefs about gender in the context of making gender attributions, see Friedman (2014).↩︎\nTo be clear, I use language like “identify as” and “consider themself” not to imply that people’s identities are less real, but to describe surveys asking people about the labels they use. Decisions about how to describe gender and sexuality are complicated and personal, and I want to maintain a distinction between the set of people who do say “yes, I am X,” and the set of people who fall under the definition of X and could say “yes, I am X” or may be grouped as X in research analyses. Often in LGBTQ+ research the set of people who could identify as X is larger than the set of people who do identify as X, which makes estimating and talking about population sizes tricky.↩︎\nKnowing a person who uses gender-neutral pronouns is more common than knowing a nonbinary person (Minkin & Brown, 2021; PRRI, 2021), but this is not particularly surprising given that not all people who use gender-neutral pronouns are nonbinary, and that people may tell others what gendered language they prefer, without getting into the details of their gender identity.↩︎\nSee Conrod (2019b)’s analysis of politeness, discussed in Section 0.5.↩︎\nAs of May 30, 2023, the Indiana bill is dead, the Arizona and North Dakota bills were vetoed by the governor, and the Tennessee bill was signed into law.↩︎\nAdvancing as of May 30, 2023.↩︎\nAs of May 23, 2023, the Indiana and New Hampshire bills are dead, the Oklahoma bill is advancing, and the Arizona and North Dakota bills were vetoed by the governor.↩︎\nDead as of May 23, 2023.↩︎\nAs of May 23, 2023, the North Dakota bills are vetoed and not advanced to a full vote, respectively.

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nIn addition to learning that the grammatical representation of they allows it to corefer with specific singular referents, learning to use they/them pronouns may require a change in how speakers access pronouns during language production. Extending existing models of pronoun production from grammatical gender to social gender (Ackerman, 2019; McConnell-Ginet, 2014) would predict that pronouns are accessed based on morphosyntactic gender marking associated with a person’s name (e.g., Schmitt et al., 1999) or based on semantic/conceptual features of a person (e.g., Antón-Méndez, 2010). In order to use they/them for a person instead of the expected he/him or she/her, speakers may instead need to recall episodic information about the person’s stated pronouns or which pronouns other speakers use to refer to them. It is clear from other contexts, such as referring to pets with he and she, that people can learn which gender-marked pronouns to use in contexts with few gender cues based on name or appearance. This suggests that learning specific singular they should be feasible, but may involve retrieving a person’s pronouns from memory, rather than inferring them based on cues such as their name.\nThe first experiment investigated how people learn to associate pronouns with a person when someone’s pronouns cannot be inferred from the gender association of their first name. Participants read a series of vignettes which introduced 12 characters, each of whom was associated with a name, pronouns (he/him, she/her, or they/them), a pet, and a job. Memory for pronouns was tested in a multiple-choice recognition task, and production of pronouns was tested in a written sentence completion task."

    "text": "1.2 Experiment 1A\n\n1.2.1 Methods\nThe design and analysis plan were preregistered on the Open Science Framework. Materials, de-identified data, and analysis code are available at this dissertation’s Github repository.\n\nParticipants\n102 undergraduate students from Vanderbilt University completed the study for partial course credit. The study was conducted online and took approximately 15 minutes. To characterize the participant sample, they were asked about their age (Mage = 19.49, SDage = 1.38); gender (79 female, 22 male, 1 nonbinary), and English experience (86 “native (learned from birth)”, 15 “fully competent in speaking, listening, reading, and writing, but not native”, 1 “limited but adequate competence in speaking, reading, and writing”). Following best practices for TGD-inclusive study design, the question about gender was a free-response box (Ansara & Hegarty, 2014; Cameron & Stinson, 2019; Zimman, 2017; NASEM, 2022).\n\n\nMaterials & Procedure\nParticipants were introduced to 12 characters, each of whom had 4 associated facts: name, pronouns, job, and pet. There were 6 typically-masculine names (Andrew, Brian, Daniel, James, Kevin, Michael) and 6 typically-feminine names (Amanda, Emily, Jessica, Laura, Melissa, Stephanie), such that 4 characters had he/him pronouns and masculine names, 4 characters had she/her pronouns and feminine names, 2 characters had they/them pronouns and masculine names, and 2 characters had they/them pronouns and feminine names. While people who use they/them pronouns have a variety of names, the choice of gendered names here means that whether a character used the gendered pronouns associated with their name or they/them could not be predicted on the basis of the name. Thus, participants had to learn each name-pronoun pairing. Characters also had 1 of 12 jobs and 1 of 3 pets. The pet fact had the same distributional characteristics as the pronouns, but was not associated with prior expectations based on the name or with strong sociopolitical beliefs, making pet learning a reference point for comparison. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 lists. Name-pronoun pairs were counterbalanced such that each name appeared with the expected he/him or she/her in 2 lists and they/them in 1 list.\nParticipants read descriptions of each character in the frame [Name] uses [pronouns]. [Name] works as a [job] and has a [pet]. After a brief distractor task consisting of simple math questions, there were two tasks measuring learning of pronouns: In the memory task, participants were given the character’s name and answered multiple-choice questions about their pronouns, job, and pet (e.g., What pronouns does Emily use? What is Emily’s job? What kind of pet does Emily have?). The 3 questions about each character always appeared together, the order of the 12 characters was pseudo-randomized, and the orders of the choices for each question were randomized. In the production task, participants saw sentence fragments for each character (in a randomized order) that included their name and job (e.g., After Emily got home from working as a teacher…). Participants were asked to complete the sentence in a way that made sense to them, to measure which pronouns (if any) they used to refer to the character (e.g., …they made dinner). Finally, participants were shown 3 characters, 1 for each pronoun, and asked what they would say if they were introducing the character to someone. This task measured if participants used a pronoun in reference to the character or specifically mentioned which pronouns the character used, as a pilot for more open-ended prompts.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Predictions\nGiven that people who use they/them pronouns report high rates of both unintentional errors and intentional misgendering (Cordoba, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2019; James et al., 2016; McLemore, 2018; The Trevor Project, 2020), we predict that he/him and she/her will be remembered and produced more accurately than they/them. This outcome could be observed for one or more reasons: Participants may be unfamiliar with singular they, or familiar with comprehending it but unused to producing it. Singular they is also less frequent than he and she, and as a result may be more difficult to use, even for speakers already familiar with it. Additionally, if participants avoid using they/them as an option, instead choosing the pronouns typically associated with the character’s name, accuracy for they/them would also be lower than accuracy for he/him and she/her. Alternatively, the relative novelty of they/them may improve memory, as distinctive information tends to be remembered better (von Restorff, 1933; Wallace, 1965). Under this account, accuracy remembering and producing they/them would be higher than for he/him and she/her.\nWe hypothesize that learning to use singular they requires a change from inferring a person’s pronoun (he or she) based on semantic/conceptual features of a person (e.g., Antón-Méndez, 2010) or based on morphosyntactic gender associated with a person’s name (e.g., Schmitt et al., 1999), and instead recalling episodic information about a person’s stated pronouns. In the context of this experiment, the gender association of the character’s name cannot predict whether that character uses he/she or they, meaning that the only way to consistently produce the correct pronouns is to remember the information from the character introductions. As a result, we predict that correctly remembering that a character uses they/them in the multiple-choice task should predict correctly producing they in the sentence completion task. Alternatively, pronoun choice in the production task may not be influenced by episodic memory for which pronouns a character uses. This would occur if, in language production, a speaker attempts to infer the character’s pronouns based on their name rather than retrieving them from memory, or if a speaker chooses to not produce singular they. In this scenario, accuracy in the memory task would not predict accuracy in the production task.\n\n\n1.2.3 Results\nResponses were analyzed using logistic mixed-effects regression models using lme4 in R (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023), with the first model analyzing memory accuracy (Table 1.1), the second analyzing production accuracy (Table 1.2), and the third analyzing a relation between memory and production accuracy (Table 1.3). The fixed effect of pronoun was coded with orthogonal Helmert contrasts; the first contrast compared they/them to he/him and she/her, and the second contrast compared he/him to she/her. In the model that included memory accuracy as a fixed effect, it was mean-center effects coded. The maximal models included by-participant and by-item (defined as the 12 names) random intercepts and slopes for pronoun (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013). The buildmer package (Voeten, 2023) was used to select the maximal converging models; all three final models included by-participant intercepts, the memory and production models also included by-participant slopes, and the memory model also included by-item intercepts.\n\nMemory\nFor accuracy in the multiple-choice memory task (Table 1.1), participants responded more accurately than inaccurately across all three pronoun conditions (β = 0.77, z = 7.36, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.77) were remembered significantly more accurately than they/them (M = 0.44) (β = 1.64, z = 9.54, p &lt; .001). Errors were asymmetric: not remembering that a character used they/them was more common than incorrectly attributing they/them to a character (Figure 1.1).\n\n\nTable 1.1: Experiment 1A: Model results for the effect of Pronoun on Memory Accuracy.\n\n\nExperiment 1A: Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMemory Accuracy\n\n\nPredictors\nLog-Odds\nSE\nz\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.768\n0.104\n7.359\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: They (-.66) vs He (+.33) + She (+.33)\n1.638\n0.172\n9.544\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: He (-.5) vs She (+.5)\n0.129\n0.217\n0.596\n0.551\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\n\nτ00 Participant\n0.443\n\n\nτ00 Name\n0.008\n\n\nτ11  Pronoun (They vs He + She) | Participant\n0.634\n\n\nτ11  Pronoun (He vs She) | Participant\n0.193\n\n\nρ01  Pronoun (They vs He + She) | Participant\n-0.425\n\n\nρ01  Pronoun (He vs She) | Participant\n0.122\n\n\nN Participant\n102\n\n\nN Name\n12\n\nObservations\n1224\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Experiment 1A: [A] Pronoun accuracy in the multiple-choice memory task.

[B] Distribution of memory responses, with the correct pronoun on the X axis and the selected pronoun by color.\n\n\n\n\nRecall that just as each character was associated with one of three pronouns, each character was also associated with one of three pets. For they/them characters, pronoun accuracy was compared to pet accuracy (M = 0.39)—which exhibits similar distributional characteristics—showing no significant difference (β = 0.21, z = 1.35, p = .18). Accuracy for the characters’ 12 possible jobs (M = 0.21) was not at floor, suggesting that overall, the task was not too difficult for participants (Figure A.1). The pet and job questions are discussed in more detail in the appendix (Section A.1.1).\n\n\nProduction\nResponses were coded by whether the sentence continuation used he/him, she/her, they/them, or no pronouns to refer to the character (Figure 1.2). Responses that did not include a pronoun referring to the character either used the character’s name as the subject of the continuing clause (e.g., After Emily got home from working as a teacher…Emily made dinner), or were ungrammatical continuations with no subject (e.g., …made dinner). Because these responses were infrequent (2% of trials) and evenly distributed between pronoun conditions, they are included in the analysis (Table 1.2) as incorrect responses. Participants responded more accurately than inaccurately across all three pronoun conditions (β = 1.33, z = 6.73, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.84) were produced significantly more accurately than they/them (M = 0.29) (β = 4.14, z = 8.80, p &lt; .001). They/them was incorrectly produced as he/him or she/her each about one third of the time, while he/him and she/her were each incorrectly produced as they/them about an eighth of the time. Approximately 60% of participants produced singular they at least once, regardless of accuracy.\n\n\nTable 1.2: Experiment 1A: Model results for the effect of Pronoun on Production Accuracy.\n\n\nExperiment 1A: Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nProduction Accuracy\n\n\nPredictors\nLog-Odds\nSE\nz\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.330\n0.198\n6.726\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: They (-.66) vs He (+.33) + She (+.33)\n4.142\n0.471\n8.802\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: He (-.5) vs She (+.5)\n-0.157\n0.472\n-0.333\n0.739\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\n\nτ00 Participant\n1.006\n\n\nτ11  Pronoun (They vs He + She) | Participant\n12.336\n\n\nτ11  Pronoun (He vs She) | Participant\n0.317\n\n\nρ01 Pronoun (They vs He + She) | Participant\n0.657\n\n\nρ01 Pronoun (He vs She) | Participant\n-0.945\n\n\nN Participant\n102\n\nObservations\n1224\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Experiment 1A: [A] Pronoun accuracy in the written sentence completion task.

Memory accuracy interacted with pronoun for the comparison between they/them and he/him + she/her (β = -0.82, z = -2.44, p &lt; .05), such that memory improved production more for they/them characters than for he/him + she/her characters (Figure 1.3).

    "section": "1.3 Experiment 1B",
    "text": "1.3 Experiment 1B\nIn the first experiment, people learned about a set of 12 characters whose pronouns—they/them or the expected he/him or she/her—could not be predicted from their name or other cues. These results demonstrate that, after only a brief exposure, people can learn that a character uses they/them pronouns and retrieve this information from memory to produce singular they in reference to them. Remembering that the character used they/them was a strong predictor of accurate pronoun production, with 48% of production trials correct when the memory trial had been correct, but only 15% of production trials correct when the memory trial had been incorrect. These results are congruent with a model where learning to use singular they requires a change from inferring a person’s pronouns (he or she) based on semantic/conceptual features of a person or based on morphosyntactic gender associated with a person’s name, and instead recalling episodic information about a person’s stated pronouns.\nWhile memory accuracy did predict production accuracy, it was not a guarantee. For they/them characters, memory was significantly more accurate than production (β = -0.80, z = -4.77, p &lt; .001). Conversely, for he/him and she/her characters, memory was significantly less accurate than production (β = 0.56, z = 4.19, p &lt; .001) (Section A.1.1). I interpret these findings as demonstrating that memory for which pronouns a person uses and accuracy when producing a person’s pronouns are distinct but interacting processes. However, another consideration is that the order of the memory and production tasks is in play. Consider that participants only had one brief exposure to information about the characters, then solved math problems for around five minutes, then answered 36 multiple-choice questions about each character’s job, pet, and pronouns. By the time participants completed the production task, they may have begun to forget which characters used they/them pronouns, instead relying more on inferences from the characters’ names. This would also result in higher production accuracy for he/him + she/her and lower production accuracy for they/them, but not necessarily due to different task demands between remembering which pronoun the character uses and selecting the correct pronoun to produce. A replication study that counterbalanced task order was conducted to ensure that the pattern of results in Experiment 1A was not determined by task order. While participants in Experiment 1A completed the memory task before the production task, participants in Experiment 1B completed the production task before the memory task. In all other respects, Experiment 1B was identical.\n\n1.3.1 Methods\n101 Vanderbilt undergraduates completed the study for partial course credit (Mage = 19.28, SDage = 1.18). 72 were women, and 29 were men, as reported in a free response box. 82 rated their English ability as “native (learned from birth)”, 17 as “fully competent, but not native”, and 2 as “limited but adequate competence.” The only difference from Experiment 1A was switching the order of the memory and production tasks.\n\n\n1.3.2 Results\nResponses were analyzed using the same logistic mixed-effects model specifications as in Experiment 1A (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023), although the maximal random effects structures that converged differed slightly in this data set. Figure 1.4 highlights results for the they/them characters; results for all three pronouns, parallel to the figures in Experiment 1A, are included in the appendix (Figure A.3, Figure A.4). To compare these results to those of Experiment 1A, an additional trio of models with the combined data included Experiment as a mean-centered fixed effect (Section A.1.3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: [A] By-participant mean memory accuracy for they/them characters, split by task order. [B] By-participant mean production accuracy for they/them characters, split by task order. [C] Production accuracy for they/them characters, split by memory accuracy and task order. Error bars indicate 95% CIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory\nAnalyzing the effects of pronoun condition on accuracy in the multiple-choice memory task (Table A.3), participants responded more accurately than inaccurately across all three pronouns (β = 0.95, z = 10.03, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.79) were remembered more accurately than they/them (M = 0.48) (β = 1.55, z = 10.88, p &lt; .001). Comparing accuracy for the 3 pets, which was designed as a control condition for pronouns, indicated that for he/him + she/her characters, pronoun accuracy was higher than pet accuracy (β = 1.74, z = 13.70, p &lt; .001). For they/them characters, the difference between pronoun and pet accuracy was not significant (β = 0.28, z = 1.85, p = .06) (Table A.6). Memory for the characters’ 12 jobs (M = 0.29, SD = 0.45) was again above floor and was numerically higher than Experiment 1A (Figure A.2). When comparing memory accuracy between experiments (Table A.7), neither the main effect of experiment (β = 0.18, z = 1.34, p = .18) nor its interactions with pronoun (β = -0.04, z = -0.22, p = .83) were significant. Overall, completing the memory task last showed little effect on accuracy.\n\n\nProduction\nWhen analyzing the effects of pronoun on accuracy in the sentence completion task (Table A.4), responses that did not include a pronoun referring to the character were again infrequent (3%) and are included in the analysis as incorrect responses. Participants used the correct pronoun to refer to the character more often than not across pronoun conditions (β = 1.11, z = 8.97, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.84) were produced more accurately than they/them (M = 0.39) (β = 2.48, z = 14.79, p &lt; .001). Overall accuracy was not significantly different from the main experiment (β = 0.13, z = 1.29, p = .20). However, the interaction between pronoun and experiment was significant (β = -0.45, z = -2.21, p &lt; .05), such that the difference in accuracy between they/them and he/him + she/her was reduced when the production task came first, compared to when the production task came second (Table A.8).\n\n\nMemory Predicting Production\nTesting the effects of pronoun condition and memory accuracy on production accuracy (Table A.5) showed that, in addition to the effects described above, participants were more likely to produce the correct pronoun if they also remembered it (β = 1.49, z = 9.27, p &lt; .001). Memory accuracy interacted with pronoun for the comparison between they/them and he/him + she/her (β = -1.16, z = -3.58, p &lt; .001), such that memory improved production more for they/them characters than for he/him + she/her characters. Remembering but not producing they/them was again more common than producing but not remembering it. Comparing between experiments (Table A.9), memory accuracy did not interact with task order (β = 0.27, z = 1.21, p = .22).\nFigure 1.5 shows each participant’s mean difference in accuracy between the two tasks. For they/them characters, participants in both experiments were more accurate in the memory task. Conversely, for he/him + she/her characters, participants in both experiments were more accurate in the production task. Both patterns are consistent with participants forgetting that a character uses they/them or choosing not to use singular they, then defaulting to the pronouns associated with the character’s name. In a linear regression with pronoun and task order predicting the by-participant mean task differences (Table A.10), there were no significant effects of task order (β = 0.00, z = 0.07, p = .95) or its interaction with pronoun (β = 0.08, z = 1.55, p = .12).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Experiments 1A & 1B: Differences between memory accuracy and production accuracy for each participant, split by character pronoun and task order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability\nTo estimate the internal reliability of the memory and production tasks, I used the Bayesian mixed-effects model approach described in (Staub, 2021). The trials from Experiments 1A & 1B were split in half, so that each half included 2 he/him, 2 she/her, and 2 they/them characters for each participant. Pronoun was coded as 2 variables: the first comparing they/them (-.66) to he/him (+.33) and she/her (+.33) in even trials, with odd trials coded as 0, and the second comparing they/them to he/him + she/her in odd trials, with even trials coded as 0. The brms package (Bürkner, 2017) fit 4 Bayesian mixed-effects models: memory and production accuracy for 1A and 1B. Each model included the odd and even trial pronoun variables as fixed effects and by-participant slopes. All models were fit using the default priors and 4 chains, each chain with 4000 iterations, of which 2000 were warm-up.\nThe random slope estimates represent the relative accuracy of they/them compared to he/him + she/her for each participant (Figure A.5). For the memory task, the correlation between slopes was low in both 1A, r = 0.34 [-0.65, 0.92], and 1B, r = 0.45 [-0.49, 0.95], indicating poor internal reliability. For the production task, the correlation between slopes was high in 1A, r = 0.91 [0.77, 0.99], but medium in 1B, r = 0.64 [0.34, 0.88]. Internal reliabilities below 0.80 for the memory task in both experiments and for the production task in 1B indicate that analyzing individual differences would not be warranted."

    "text": "1.4 Discussion\nExperiment 1 investigated how people associate pronouns with a person, in a context where producing the correct pronoun required recalling stated information about the character’s pronouns, instead of choosing the pronoun based on the gender association of the name or an inference about the gender of the character. Participants learned about a set of 12 characters whose pronouns—they/them or the expected he/him or she/her—could not be predicted from their name or other cues. Memory for pronouns was measured in a multiple-choice task, and production of pronouns was measured in a written sentence completion task. After only a brief exposure to the characters, participants correctly recalled that the character used they/them pronouns in about half of trials and correctly produced singular they in reference to the character in about a third of trials. Participants originally completed the memory task before the production task, and a follow-up experiment presented the production task first, to rule out the possibility that differences between memory and production accuracy were caused by task order. In both experiments, remembering that the character used they/them pronouns strongly predicted—but did not guarantee—producing singular they. These results provide support for a model where speakers can select pronouns by retrieving information from episodic memory about a person’s stated pronouns, instead of selecting pronouns based on morphosyntactic gender information from the name or a gender inference about the person.\nOne limitation is that Experiment 1 was conducted with undergraduate students at a private university, which represents a particular subset of English speakers located in the US: primarily ages 18–22 and highly educated. Prior data allows us to infer that the participants are more likely to be socially liberal, have prior knowledge about LGBTQ+ topics, and to consider singular they acceptable (Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019). However, more extensive demographic and language experience data were not included in the first experiment, because investigation of individual differences would first need to establish the internal reliability of the measures, in order to then be able to associate them with other person-specific variables.\nThere is an increasing awareness in psycholinguistics, and in cognitive psychology more broadly, of the importance of demonstrating sufficient internal reliability as a first step in conducting individual differences research (Cronbach, 1957; Hedge et al., 2017; Staub, 2021). This often proves difficult, because reliably measuring effects of experimental manipulations and reliably measuring individual differences are mathematically at odds with each other. Individual differences measures aim to characterize between-participant variability (e.g., the extent to which someone endorses the gender binary and gender essentialism), and reliability means that the measure ranks participants consistently. This requires a low degree of within-participant variability: participants’ responses would be consistent both within trials in the same experiment and if they completed the experiment again at a later date. Conversely, most cognitive psychology measures aim to characterize changes in behavior in different experimental contexts (e.g., singular they takes more time to read than plural they), which is within-participant variability. In this context, reliability means that the effect replicates in different experiments. This requires a low degree of between-participant variability, where most participants show the same pattern of responses. Hedge et al. (2017) describe this incompatibility as the “reliability paradox,” because “robust experimental paradigms…are likely to be sub-optimal for correlational studies for the same reasons that they produce robust experimental effects.”\nIf a measure shows low internal reliability—where each participant’s responses are not consistent within halves of the same experiment, or when completing the experiment twice—testing for individual differences would be possible, but not warranted (Hedge et al., 2017). One of the primary issues is that the reliability of the measures constrains the maximum expected true correlation that one would expect to find (Spearman, 1904), meaning that correlations with a low-reliability task will be underestimated. This is the position we find ourselves in with Experiment 1. Analyzing the data using Staub (2021)’s split-half mixed-effects model approach showed that the internal reliability of the memory task (rA = 0.34, rB = 0.45) was too low to warrant individual differences analysis, and the reliability of the production task was high enough in Experiment 1A but not 1B (rA = 0.91, rB = 0.64). While increasing the number of trials per participant can increase reliability (Liceralde & Watson, 2023), this is not feasible with a memory task, as adding more characters to learn about would make the experiment too difficult for participants. Overall, this means that while people clearly do vary in their accuracy remembering and producing singular they, it is not clear how much of this variability arises from theoretically-interesting factors (e.g., language and gender beliefs), how much arises from general psychological factors (e.g., ability in memory tests, attention to the experiment), and how much is random noise. Instead of pursuing individual differences questions with the character learning task, we turn to investigating how presenting information about singular they can support accurate memory and production.\n\n\n\n\nAckerman, L.

    "section": "2.1 Motivation",
    "text": "2.1 Motivation\nThe results of Experiment 1 suggest that people can learn to associate pronouns with a person, but that accuracy for they/them remains lower than for he/him and she/her. Although remembering which characters used they/them was a strong predictor of producing singular they, accuracy in the sentence completion task was significantly lower than in the multiple-choice memory task. Experiment 2 investigated what kinds of exposure can support accurately remembering and producing singular they. The first factor tested is the role of conceptual knowledge about singular they and discussing gendered language preferences. Recent results show that participants are more likely to interpret they as the intended singular, instead of plural, after being told explicitly that the character uses they/them pronouns (Arnold et al., 2021) (see Section 0.4.4). This is also supported by prior experiments about the generic masculine: When a course instructor included information about why they would be using generic she instead of generic he (Adamsky, 1981), and when alternatives were taught as options to students (Flanagan & Todd-Mancillas, 1982), students were less likely to use generic he in their assignments and more likely to use gender-neutral alternatives or generic she. Similarly, in German (where nouns are gender-marked) reading brief arguments in favor of gender-neutral language increased participants’ use of gender-neutral generic nouns (Koeser & Sczesny, 2014).\nThe second factor tested is exposure. As singular they becomes more common and accepted (Balhorn, 2004; Camilliere et al., 2021; Hekanaho, 2020; Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019), speakers are increasingly likely to be exposed to it via media and social circles, and many of these instances do not come prefaced with a discussion about pronouns or gender identity. Potentially-comparable results from studies about non-sexist language reforms are mixed: students who saw alternatives to generic masculine forms modeled in task instructions increased their use of non-sexist forms, but did not decrease their use of generic masculine forms (Cronin & Jreisat, 1995). In German, women were more likely to use alternatives to generic masculine role nouns after reading a text modeling them, but men did not change their language use until the instructions drew their attention to the gendered language used (Koeser et al., 2015)."

Participants were required to be in the U.S. and comfortable reading and writing in English. 107 participants were excluded for nonsensical responses in the sentence completion task, for a total of 320 participants in the final data set. As in Experiment 1, participants were asked about their age (Mage = 38.79, SDage = 11.54), gender (194 male, 125 female, 1 did not provide), and English experience (304 “native (learned from birth)”, 14 “fully competent, but not native”, 1 “limited but adequate competence”, 1 “some familiarity”) in order to characterize the sample.\n\n\n2.2.2 Materials & Procedure\nParticipants read 1 of 2 500-word PSAs. The pronoun PSA was modified from a GLSEN resource and discussed talking about gendered language preferences, using singular they, and responding to misgendering someone (GLSEN, 2020). The neutral PSA was modified from a Humane Society resource and discussed the importance of spaying/neutering cats and dogs (Humane Society, 2020). Participants also read 2 fictional biographies, which made repeated third-person reference to a single character, in order to model pronoun use without explicitly commenting on it. The character in the first biography had a feminine name and was referred to with they/them or she/her pronouns (4 subject, 1 object, 4 possessive). The character in the second biography had a masculine name and was referred to with they/them or he/him pronouns (7 subject, 7 possessive). The other materials were identical to Experiment 1.\nParticipants read 1 PSA and 1 pair of biographies (2 they/them characters, or 1 he/him character and 1 she/her character). These were crossed to create 4 between-participants conditions [PSA: Gendered Language vs Unrelated; Biographies: They vs He/She]. Participants then completed the same pronoun memory and production tasks as in Experiment 1. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 lists within each condition, counterbalancing the name-pronoun combinations. The experiment was coded and hosted using PCIbex (Zehr & Schwartz, 2018)."

    "text": "2.3 Predictions\nThe PSA contains information about why paying attention to gendered language matters, mentions singular they as an option and shows examples of its usage, and provides scripts for talking about gendered language preferences (GLSEN, 2020). This addresses conceptual knowledge about singular they and misgendering, chosen to be similar to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion materials that people may see in their schools or workplaces. If learning or being reminded of this information affects language use, we predict that participants who read the gendered language PSA will be more accurate at remembering and producing they/them, compared to participants who read the unrelated PSA.\nAs singular they becomes more common and accepted (Balhorn, 2004; Camilliere et al., 2021; Hekanaho, 2020; Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019), speakers are increasingly likely to be exposed to it via media and social circles, and many of these instances do not come prefaced with a discussion about gendered language or gender identity. As such, the biographies model the use of singular they, but do not explicitly call attention to it. The biography genre allows for repeated reference to one individual, giving participants multiple examples and making it more straightforward to interpret they as singular and not plural. If seeing singular they modeled supports learning, we predict that participants who read the stories about characters referred to with they/them pronouns will be more accurate at remembering and producing singular they, compared to participants who read the stories about characters referred to with he/him and she/her pronouns."

The fixed effects of PSA and Biography were mean-center effects coded; all other model specifications followed Experiment 1 (Baayen et al., 2008; Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023). For all three models, the most complex random effects structure that converged included only by-item intercepts, and no by-participant effects.\n\n2.4.1 Memory\nIn the multiple-choice memory task (Table 2.1), participants responded more accurately than not across pronouns and training conditions (β = 1.00, z = 21.47, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.77–0.82 between PSA and Biography conditions) were remembered more accurately than they/them (M = 0.51–0.59) (β = 1.22, z = 16.02, p &lt; .001). There was no difference in accuracy between he/him and she/her, and they/them was misremembered as he/him and she/her at similar rates (Figure 2.1A). The lower accuracy of they/them compared to she/her and he/him (Figure 2.1B) was attenuated when participants read the gendered language PSA compared to the unrelated PSA (β = -0.36, z = -2.38, p &lt; .05).\n\n\nTable 2.1: Experiment 2: Model results for the effects of Pronoun, PSA, and Biography on Memory Accuracy.\n\n\nExperiment 2: Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMemory Accuracy\n\n\nPredictors\nLog-Odds\nSE\nz\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.996\n0.046\n21.467\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: They (-.66) vs He (+.33) + She (+.33)\n1.218\n0.076\n16.023\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: He (-.5) vs She (+.5)\n0.140\n0.111\n1.265\n0.206\n\n\nBiography: He/She (-.5) vs Biography: They (+.5)\n-0.176\n0.076\n-2.304\n0.021\n\n\nPSA: Unrelated (-.5) vs PSA: Gendered Language (+.5)\n0.022\n0.076\n0.289\n0.772\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * PSA\n-0.362\n0.152\n-2.381\n0.017\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * PSA\n0.121\n0.199\n0.609\n0.543\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * Biography\n-0.161\n0.152\n-1.060\n0.289\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * Biography\n0.049\n0.199\n0.245\n0.807\n\n\nPSA * Biography\n-0.073\n0.153\n-0.481\n0.630\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * PSA * Biography\n-0.131\n0.304\n-0.431\n0.666\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * PSA * Biography\n-0.088\n0.398\n-0.220\n0.826\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\n\nτ00 Name\n0.008\n\n\nN Name\n12\n\nObservations\n3840\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Experiment 2: [A] Pronoun accuracy in the multiple-choice memory task, split by PSA and Biography conditions.

The distribution of responses is shown in the appendix (Figure A.7).\n\n\n\n\nParticipants also learned that each character had 1 of 3 pets, which was designed to have the same distributional characteristics but be less marked in comparison to the 3 pronouns. As in Experiment 1, there was no significant difference between accuracy for they/them characters’ pets (M = 0.54) and pronouns (β = 0.05, z = 0.48, p = .63). Accuracy for the 12 possible jobs was relatively high (M = 0.37), confirming that the experiment was not too difficult for participants. Job and pet accuracy are discussed in more detail in the appendix (Section A.2.1).\n\n\n2.4.2 Production\nResponses were coded by whether the sentence continuation used he/him, she/her, they/them, or no pronouns to refer to the character (Figure 2.2). Responses that did not include a pronoun were 4% of the data and are included in the analysis as incorrect responses (Table 2.2). Across all conditions, participants produced the correct pronoun more often than not (β = 0.70, z = 13.47, p &lt; .001). He/him and she/her (M = 0.79–0.90 between PSA and Biography conditions) were produced more accurately than they/them (M = 0.11–0.33) (β = 3.16, z = 32.95, p &lt; .001). He/him was produced somewhat more accurately than she/her (β = -0.26, z = -2.11, p &lt; .05). The relative difficulty of they/them was attenuated with the gendered language PSA (β = -1.91, z = -10.00, p &lt; .001), and there was a significant interaction between PSA and Biography (β = 0.43, z = 2.34, p &lt; .05). These effects were qualified by a three-way interaction between Pronoun, PSA, and Biography (β = 0.88, z = 2.31, p &lt; .05). A follow-up analysis probing this interaction found that the gendered language PSA reduced the relative difficulty of they/them more when paired with the biographies that used he/him and she/her (β = -2.35, z = -8.50, p &lt; .001) than when paired with the biographies that used they/them (β = -1.47, z = -5.57, p &lt; .001). However, examining the means for the two conditions with the gendered language PSA (red in Figure 2.2B) indicates that the difference in relative accuracy for they/them compared to he/him + she/her is due to Biography affecting accuracy for he/him + she/her characters, but not accuracy for they/them characters. Finally, an exploratory analysis measured the proportion of participants who produced singular they at all, regardless of accuracy (Table A.13). Participants who read the gendered language PSA were more likely to produce singular they at least once (β = 0.93, z = 3.95, p &lt; .001), with proportions rising from 26% and 35% in conditions that read the unrelated PSA to 48% and 57% in conditions that read the gendered language PSA.\n\n\nTable 2.2: Experiment 2: Model results for the effects of Pronoun, PSA, and Biography on Production Accuracy.\n\n\nExperiment 2: Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nProduction Accuracy\n\n\nPredictors\nLog-Odds\nSE\nz\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.695\n0.052\n13.469\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: They (-.66) vs He (+.33) + She (+.33)\n3.156\n0.096\n32.951\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun: He (-.5) vs She (+.5)\n-0.261\n0.123\n-2.113\n0.035\n\n\nPSA: Unrelated (-.5) vs PSA: Gendered Language (+.5)\n0.107\n0.091\n1.178\n0.239\n\n\nBiography: He/She (-.5) vs Biography: They (+.5)\n-0.059\n0.091\n-0.653\n0.514\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * PSA\n-1.907\n0.191\n-9.999\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * PSA\n0.266\n0.227\n1.170\n0.242\n\n\nPSA * Biography\n0.426\n0.182\n2.345\n0.019\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * Biography\n-0.160\n0.191\n-0.840\n0.401\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * Biography\n0.085\n0.227\n0.372\n0.710\n\n\nPronoun (They vs He + She) * PSA * Biography\n0.882\n0.381\n2.313\n0.021\n\n\nPronoun (He vs She) * PSA * Biography\n0.134\n0.454\n0.296\n0.768\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\n\nτ00 Name\n0.007\n\n\nN Name\n12\n\nObservations\n3840\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Experiment 2: [A] Pronoun accuracy in the written sentence completion task, split by PSA and Biography conditions.

No other interactions with memory accuracy were significant.

    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nIn Experiment 2, participants read either a PSA about gendered language or an unrelated topic, then two fictional biographies where both characters used they/them or one character used he/him and one character used she/her. Participants then completed the same character learning, memory, and production tasks as in Experiment 1. Reading the PSA about gendered language—which explained why people are talking more about their preferences for gendered language, how they/them pronouns work, and how to respond if someone corrects you—increased how likely participants were to produce singular they at least once and improved their accuracy when doing so. Seeing singular they modeled in the biographies did not directly affect memory or production, but did interact with the PSA. This demonstrates that while learning singular they may be difficult, it is not impossible, and even brief interventions can support this learning.\nCompared to Experiment 1, which included undergraduates participating for course credit, Amazon MTurk participants vary more—particularly in terms of age, race, education, and socioeconomic status—but are still not fully representative of English speakers in the U.S. context (Arechar & Rand, 2021; Levay et al., 2016). MTurk participants lean more liberal than U.S. adults, and are more likely to agree that trans people are discriminated against and to support marriage equality and anti-discrimination laws for gay people (Chandler et al., 2019; Levay et al., 2016). Most, but not all, participants in both experiments reported being native English speakers; while all participants in Experiment 1 were physically located in the U.S., in Experiment 2 the web-based restrictions that limited participation to U.S.-based individuals may not have been foolproof.\nHowever, overall performance was, broadly speaking, similar across the two studies despite the sampling differences: While participants in the Unrelated PSA + He/She Biographies condition—the condition in Experiment 2 most similar to Experiment 1—were less likely to correctly produce they than participants in Experiment 1 (M1A = 0.29, M1B = 0.39, M2 = 0.11), this is unlikely to be due to overall lower accuracy or attention to the task. Looking at the memory questions unrelated to pronouns, participants in Experiment 2 were numerically more accurate than participants in Experiment 1 for both the characters’ jobs (M1A = 0.21, M1B = 0.29, M2 = 0.37) and pets (M1A = 0.41, M1B = 0.43, M2 = 0.54). While participants in Experiment 2 were less likely to have experience with singular they than participants in Experiment 1, the PSA manipulation was intended to provide participants with some of the social context around gendered language that they may have been less familiar with. In sum, these findings show that providing people with brief information about how they/them pronouns work, why people use them, and why people choose to talk directly about the gendered language they prefer did support peoples’ use of singular they. Whether or not this effect may vary depending on participants’ prior knowledge and experience is an area for future research.\nThe finding that reading a brief PSA increased both the overall usage and accuracy of singular they is promising, given that a PSA is an easily implemented and not time-intensive tool. Nevertheless, in order to be useful in applied contexts, future research will need to investigate whether the effects of the gendered language PSA and other learning interventions persist past the duration of an experiment. Future work should also investigate whether the effects on written production extend to spoken production.\n\n\n\n\nAdamsky, C. (1981). Changes in pronominal usage in a classroom situation.

    "text": "3.1 Motivation\nEncouraging people to include their pronouns when introducing themselves and providing space for people to indicate their pronouns in display names, email signatures, and nametags are common recommendations for making environments inclusive of TGD people (Richards & Barker, 2013). Options to specify your pronouns are currently included in many social media platforms such as Instagram and LinkedIn, in institutional platforms such as Brightspace and Slack, and in tools such as Zoom and Github. Ideally, group norms of indicating pronouns makes disclosure less marked, which supports the individuals who need to explicitly state their pronouns in order to avoid being misgendered—which is the majority of people who use they/them pronouns, in the majority of contexts.\nSome recent research has investigated the effects of pronoun-sharing practices. Both TGD and other LGBQ+ people evaluated a potential workplace more positively when a biography of a staff member included that she used she/her pronouns, when she/her would have been assumed (Johnson et al., 2021). This suggests that other people indicating their pronouns can act as an identity-safety cue when TGD and LGBQ+ people are forming initial appraisals of an environment, so they may be more likely to choose that environment and be more comfortable being out.1 Additionally, directly explaining that a character used they/them supported people’s ability to correctly comprehend they as singular, not plural (Arnold et al., 2021) (see Section 0.4.4).\nAn unanswered question, however, is whether pronoun-sharing practices affect people’s language production—specifically, if they reduce the frequency of misgendering and support accurate use of singular they. While creating an environment where TGD people feel safe asking for the correct gendered language and where others understand the usage of singular they are both good outcomes, EDI practices need to affect allies’ concrete behavior (e.g., Kattari et al., 2018), beyond their knowledge and attitudes.\nIn the first two experiments, I have argued for a model where learning to use they/them pronouns requires retrieving information about a person’s pronouns from episodic memory, instead of inferring pronouns from morphosyntactic features of their name or from an inference about their gender. Experiment 1 demonstrated that when a character’s pronouns cannot be inferred from their name, people can learn to associate pronouns with the character and use that information in language production, and Experiment 2 demonstrated that accurately producing they/them pronouns can be supported by providing participants with information about why paying attention to a person’s pronouns is important. Experiment 3 moves from testing an intervention that may influence how participants pay attention to and attempt to recall information about a person’s pronouns to comparing different ways of presenting information about pronouns. The current experiment investigates two practices for providing explicit information about what pronouns a person uses: stating pronouns when introducing someone, which makes this information highly salient at the beginning of the conversation, and including pronouns on someone’s nametag/display name, which keeps this information accessible throughout the conversation. Ideally, pronoun-sharing practices will support production of singular they. However, pronoun-sharing practices may not consistently impact pronoun production—at all, or at least not to a degree that has real-world applicability. The frequency of seemingly-counterintuitive errors like “she uses they/them” shows that speakers may have information about a person’s pronouns available, but still produce the incorrect pronoun."

Sources and attributions for the images are included with the materials, and the edited images are available upon request. The de-identified data and analysis code are available at this dissertation’s Github repository.\n\n3.2.1 Participants\nA simulation-based power analysis using the simr package in R (Green & MacLeod, 2016) estimated the number of participants required to detect a 2-way interaction between the condition manipulation and pronoun type with the same effect size (β = -1.91, OR = 0.15) as the production task in Experiment 2. This indicated that 156 participants, each completing 30 trials, would have 0.93 [0.91, 0.94] power at α = .05 to detect the interaction.\nParticipants were recruited from Prolific (Peer et al., 2022) and required to be over the age of 18, be native or advanced speakers of English, and have a device with a microphone to record audio. The task took approximately 20 minutes. 162 participants are included in the analysis, with an additional 11 participants excluded for stopping the study before completing 25 test trials, having technical errors saving data, or having &gt;5 test trial recordings that did not include a response to the task. Participant demographics are described in Table 3.1.\n\n\n3.2.2 Materials\n\nCharacters\nParticipants were introduced to 3 characters, each of whom was associated with a set of pronouns (1 he/him, 1 she/her, 1 they/them), a name, an image, a pictured brother character, and a pictured sister character. The character images were selected from The Gender Spectrum Collection, a stock photo library created to provide a diverse range of images of transgender and nonbinary people (Drucker, 2019). The sibling images were selected from a free-use stock photo database. Each image was edited to show 1 person from the shoulders up with a white background. Nametags were shown in white text on a black bar along the bottom of the image, resembling display names in the Zoom interface. For characters, the nametags showed the first name and, depending on the condition, their pronouns. For siblings, the nametags showed [character name]’s [brother/sister], in order to limit the number of names participants needed to learn and to elicit possessive pronouns referring to the character.\nAcross the lists, there were 6 images for the main characters. These were selected by conducting a norming study on 12 images. Participants (N = 30) on Prolific saw each image paired with a sentence completion prompt, which referred to the pictured person as “this person” and did not include a name (e.g., This person made a mug of tea. Before it cooled…). No information about pronouns was included, either in the instructions or in the prompts. Participants wrote a completion to each prompt, in order to measure which pronouns, if any, were chosen to refer to the character (Table A.14). Unlike in the first two studies, participants produced they/them frequently (71% of responses). This is potentially due to prompts not including names, as well as a different participant population on Prolific compared to MTurk. From the results of this norming study, 3 images where people did not produce she/her pronouns and 3 images where people did not produce he/him pronouns were selected. The goal was to create stimuli where we can expect that participants are primarily choosing between he/him and they/them or between she/her and they/them, not between all three, which may involve a different mechanism. This design allows us to test if including pronouns on nametags and in introductions increases accuracy for they/them, as compared to the pronouns that speakers would typically have defaulted to. This is the situation in which many people who use they/them find themselves, where they want people to stop using he/him or she/her pronouns. Additionally, the decision between he/him and she/her involves additional social dynamics that are outside the scope of the current study.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 lists, in order to counterbalance the images and names associated with the character who uses they/them. Out of the 6 images, 3 appeared twice with he/him and once with they/them across lists, and 3 appeared twice with she/her and once with they/them across lists. There were 6 names, all gender-neutral: Alex, Casey, Jaime, Jordan, Sam, Taylor (Flowers, 2015). While people who use they/them pronouns use a variety of names, this experiment uses gender-neutral names because counterbalancing the gender associations of the names within lists was not feasible. Critically, across lists they/them appears once with each image and once with each name, in order to avoid confounding interpretations about which aspects of a person’s name or appearance may make it easier for someone to learn that they use they/them pronouns.\n\n\nPronoun Elicitation Task\nFollowing a task established by Pozzan & Antón-Méndez (2017), each trial showed 2 characters in the center of the screen, with their siblings in the 4 corners (Figure 3.1). An animation showed an object moving from a character to one of their siblings, and participants verbally described what happened. This was designed to elicit possessive pronouns about the target character, e.g., Jaime gave the apple to their brother. It also allowed participants to produce subject pronouns referring to the character, e.g., They gave the apple to their brother, or to avoid pronouns entirely, e.g., Jaime gave the apple to Jaime’s brother. Trials manipulated which pronouns the two pictured characters used [Pronoun Pair]: they/them targets with he/him or she/her distractors [They|HeShe], he/him and she/her targets with they/them distractors [HeShe|They], and he/him and she/her targets with she/her or he/him distractors [HeShe|SheHe]. Trials also counterbalanced whether the object was passed to the brother or the sister and the locations of the characters. These trial frames were identical for each of the 6 character lists. Unlike Pozzan & Antón-Méndez (2017), no filler trials were included, as it was not possible to conceal that the study was targeting pronoun production.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Experiment 3: Example Trial in the +⁠Nametag condition, which preferentially elicited “Jaime gave the apple to their brother.”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Procedure\n\nIntroductions to Characters\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 between-participants conditions, manipulating what information about pronouns was given [+⁠Nametag vs –⁠Nametag; +⁠Introduction vs –⁠Introduction], then to 1 of 6 lists within each condition, counterbalancing the images and names of the characters. First, participants read introductions to 3 characters (1 he/him, 1 she/her, 1 they/them) (Figure 3.2). The characters were introduced by name, and in the +⁠Introduction condition, their pronouns were explicitly stated (e.g., This is Jaime, who uses they/them pronouns). The images associated with each character included their name, resembling a display name in Zoom; in the +⁠Nametag conditions, the images also included the character’s pronouns in parentheses after their name. Each character had a brother and a sister, whose nametags indicated their relationship to the character. In all conditions, the facts about the character and the introductions to their siblings included 3 instances of the character’s pronouns, with the character facts preceding the sibling introductions to reduce the ambiguity of singular they (i.e., not plural referring to the character and the sibling introduced next).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Experiment 3: Stimuli and Procedure. [A] Example stimuli for the introductions to the characters, shown for the +⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction and –⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction conditions. [B] Experiment procedure.\n\n\n\n\nSpeech Production\nParticipants saw 1 example trial for each character, which demonstrated the frame [Name] gave the [object] to [their/his/her] [brother/sister] and included another instance of the character’s pronouns. Participants then completed 1 practice trial for each character, to learn the timing of the task. Each scene, with the object moving from beside a character to beside their brother or sister, took a total of 5 seconds. Then the microphone recorded for 8 seconds, with the images remaining on the screen. After each practice trial, participants read feedback in the frame Did you say something like, “[Name] gave the [object] to [their/his/her] [brother/sister]?” At this point in the experiment, participants in the condition where the characters’ pronouns were not directly indicated (–⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction) had observed 5 examples of each characters’ pronouns. Participants then completed 30 test trials, which did not include feedback. The order of all trials was randomized. Trials were divided evenly between 3 within-subjects conditions, which varied the pronouns of both the target character and the other pictured character [Pronoun Pair: They|HeShe; HeShe|They; HeShe|SheHe].\n\n\nSurvey\nAfter the speech production task, participants completed a survey measuring their prior beliefs about singular they and TGD identities. First, they judged 6 sentences using singular they: coreferring with generic antecedents (e.g., the ideal barista), quantified antecedents (e.g., each dog owner, every music fan), and proper names (masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral). Items were drawn from Conrod (2019), and participants rated them on a Likert scale with 1 being “very unnatural” and 7 being “very natural.” Second, participants were asked about their prior familiarity with using they/them and pronoun-sharing practices. They could choose one or more options: use they/them for themself, close to someone who uses they/them, have met someone who uses they/them, have heard about using they/them but have not met anyone who does, and have not heard anything about using they/them. For including pronouns in introduction and in places like nametags or signatures, participants indicated frequency in the groups they were a part of (all, most, some, a few, none) and for themselves (always, usually, sometimes, rarely, never because prefer not to, never because had not heard of it). Third, participants completed Nagoshi et al.’s Transphobia Scale, which measures endorsement of gender essentialism and the gender binary, and discomfort with people who violate these expectations (Nagoshi et al., 2008; see also Tebbe & Moradi, 2012); this is referred to as the Gender Beliefs measure from here forward.\nFinally, participants completed demographic questions. They were asked about their age, gender, and sexuality, as prior work indicates that being younger and part of the LGBTQ+ community correlates with higher acceptability ratings for singular they (Camilliere et al., 2021; Conrod, 2019; Hekanaho, 2020; Hernandez, 2020). The question about gender was two steps: a free-response box, then options to indicate whether their gender was the same or different than the sex indicated on their original birth certificate. This follows recommendations for identifying the broadest set of TGD people: anyone whose gender does not match their sex assigned at birth, of whom not all call themselves transgender. This format also accounts for the fact that terms for gender vary widely, allowing participants to choose the language that best describes them, but avoiding relying on terms that many participants may not be familiar with (Ansara & Hegarty, 2014; Cameron & Stinson, 2019; NASEM, 2022; Zimman, 2017). In addition to or instead of the options for sex assigned at birth, participants could indicate whether they considered themselves cisgender, transgender, or neither. Although these factors do not relate directly to the current research questions, participants were also asked about their race, ethnicity, and education level, in order to characterize the participant sample (Buchanan et al., 2021). All demographic questions included the option to not respond. The experiment was coded and hosted using PCIbex (Zehr & Schwartz, 2018)."

    "text": "3.3 Predictions\nLike in the first two experiments, we expect to observe lower accuracy for they/them characters compared to he/him and she/her characters, but recall that the characters in Experiment 3 differ in several ways. First, instead of masculine or feminine names, where two thirds of the characters used the expected he/him or she/her and one third used they/them, all of the names here are gender-neutral. If participants rely on lexical knowledge about the gender associations of the name to select a pronoun, responses would be split between he/him or she/her, instead of being strongly biased to one or the other. Second, the characters now include images, which provide additional information that participants may be using to make an inference about the character’s gender and then to select pronouns. Third—while still brief—the introductions to the characters here contain more repetitions of the character’s pronouns. While the introductions to the characters in Experiments 1 & 2 stated their pronouns directly but did not use pronouns to refer to the character (e.g., This is Emily, who uses they/them pronouns. Emily…), participants in all four Experiment 3 conditions see each character’s pronouns used three times in the introductions, once in the example trials, and once in the practice trials. Putting aside potential differences between spoken and written production for the moment, this means that we may see higher accuracy for they/them in the –⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction condition than in Experiments 1 & 2, since information about the characters’ pronouns is presented multiple times.\nThe primary hypotheses concern whether the Nametag and Introduction conditions attenuate the lower accuracy of singular they. Including pronouns in introductions makes the information about pronouns salient at the beginning. If speakers use this information in production—presumably by retrieving it from episodic memory—we would expect to see a smaller penalty for they/them in the two +⁠Introduction conditions. Alternatively, if speakers do not remember the information about the character’s pronouns from the beginning of the experiment, or if this information is not used when selecting the pronoun to produce, we would see no differences between the +⁠Introduction and –⁠Introduction conditions.\nIncluding pronouns on the characters’ nametags keeps the information accessible throughout the experiment, and compared to the Introduction manipulation, does not require speakers to retrieve information from episodic memory. If speakers use the nametag information when selecting the pronoun to produce, we would expect to see a smaller penalty for they/them in the two +⁠Nametag conditions. If speakers do not use the nametag information, instead relying on their lexical knowledge of the name or an inference about the character’s gender based on their appearance, we would see no differences between the +⁠Nametag and –⁠Nametag conditions.\nIf the introductions and nametags do reduce the relative difficulty of singular they, the combination of the two may be more effective than just one, resulting in the higher accuracy for the +⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction condition compared to the +⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction and the –⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction conditions. This could result if including pronouns in introductions directs people to pay attention to the nametags, and if the nametags serve as a cue to retrieve the a memory of the introduction information."

    "section": "3.4 Results",
    "text": "3.4 Results\n\n3.4.1 Participant Backgrounds\nParticipants were older than the typical college student sample (range = 19–81, Mdn = 34). Around half the participants were women, and 6 were under the nonbinary umbrella. 6 participants said that their gender was different than their sex assigned at birth and/or that they considered themselves transgender, and 38 were LGBQ+ (Table 3.1). These rates are somewhat higher than the U.S. average, but in line with previous data about the Prolific participant population (Douglas et al., 2023). Overall, just about all participants were at least somewhat familiar with singular they before the experiment: a third had heard about people using they/them pronouns but had not met anyone who does, a third had met but were not close to anyone who uses they/them, and a third were close to someone who uses they/them and/or used they/them themselves (Figure 3.3D). Similarly, most participants were familiar with including pronouns when introducing yourself and on nametags/display names, but didn’t consider it a part of their or their social circles’ norms. When describing their own habits, about half said they never do either because they prefer not to, about a quarter said they do rarely or sometimes, and about a tenth said they do usually or always (Figure 3.3B). When describing what people around them do, about a third were never around people who share pronouns, about half were rarely or sometimes around people who share pronouns, and about a fifth were usually or always around people who share pronouns (Figure 3.3C). Including pronouns on nametags was somewhat more common than including pronouns in introductions, which is unsurprising given that the former can be less marked. When rating the naturalness of singular they coreferring with different types of referents (Figure 3.3A), acceptance of indefinite forms was generally high (M = 5.56, SD = 1.48), and acceptance of proper names was more variable (M = 4.58, SD = 1.97) and was significantly lower (β = 0.98, t = 4.89, p &lt; .001) (Table A.16). For gender beliefs (Nagoshi et al., 2008), responses on a 1–7 Likert scale were scaled to the 0–6 range, giving a total range of 0–54, with higher scores indicating higher endorsement of the gender binary and gender essentialism and thus less favorable attitudes about trans and gender-nonconforming people (Figure 3.3E). Participant totals spanned the entire scale (range = 0–52), but were skewed towards the lower end, with a mean response that was moderately favorable towards trans and gender-nonconforming people (M = 18.02, SD = 14.38; see Table A.17 for item text and means). While this experiment did not include direct measures of political affiliation, other studies show that the Prolific population skews left, with 35% identifying as a strong Democrat, and only 20% identifying as a strong, weak, or independent Republican (Douglas et al., 2023).\n\n\nTable 3.1: Experiment 3: Participant Demographics. The trans & gender diverse and sexuality categories have variable totals, as participants could select multiple options.

The black line is the mean response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Distribution of Pronouns Produced\nTrials were automatically transcribed using whisper (Radford et al., 2022), then checked to include disfluencies. After excluding trials that were inaudible or did not include a response to the task (1.17% of data), 4803 trials were included in the analysis. Each trial was coded for pronoun(s) referring to the target character, which occurred in nearly all trials (98.44%). Because subject pronouns were infrequent (1 he, 2 she, 2 they) and did not occur in trials without a corresponding possessive pronoun, the analyses only include possessive pronouns. There were no outliers between the 6 lists varying the name-image-pronoun combinations (Figure A.8).\nFigure 3.4A shows the distribution of final pronouns produced by target character and condition. Trials with one pronoun are shown in darker colors; trials with multiple pronouns (e.g., Jaime gave the apple to her bro—to their brother, 1.60%) show the final pronoun in lighter colors. Participants were numerically more likely to not use pronouns for they/them characters (N = 31) than for he/him (N = 22) and she/her characters (N = 22), but the comparison between the mean rates of no-pronoun responses for they/them and he/him + she/her was not statistically significant, t(2747.18) = -1.42, p = .16. Rather, participants who only used names (e.g., Jaime gave the apple to Jaime’s brother) tended to do so for all 3 characters. In trials where participants produced multiple pronouns, self-corrections from his to their (N = 14) and her to their (N = 23) were more common than self-corrections from their to his (N = 5) or her (N = 8), or between his and her (N = 12, N = 15). Unexpectedly, their responses for each participant were typically at floor or near ceiling (Figure 3.4B), with the Nametag and Introduction conditions affecting whether a participant produced their at all, more than affecting accuracy within participants who produced their in some trials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Experiment 3: Distribution of Responses.[A] Final pronoun produced. Trials where participants used multiple pronouns to refer to the character (e.g., Jaime gave the apple to her bro—to their brother) are grouped based on the final pronoun and shown in lighter colors. [B] Number of their responses per participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Pronoun Accuracy\nThe primary analysis measured accuracy of pronouns referring to the target character (Figure 3.5). Trials where participants produced different pronouns (1.60%) were coded based on the final pronoun (e.g., Jaime gave the apple to her bro—to their brother would be coded based on the accuracy of their); trials with no pronouns (1.56%) were excluded from this analysis. Pronoun was manipulated between both the character described (target) and the other character pictured on the screen (distractor). The first Pronoun Pair contrast compared trials with they/them target characters to trials with he/him and she/her target characters (They|HeShe vs HeShe|They + HeShe|They). Within he/him and she/her character trials, the second contrast compared trials with they/them distractors to trials with he/him and she/her distractors (HeShe|They vs HeShe|They). There were no significant effects of the second Pronoun Pair contrast, so for simplicity’s sake, the first Pronoun Pair contrast is referred to as the effect of Pronoun from here on. The fixed effects of Nametag and Introduction (between-participants) were both mean-center effects coded. The maximal model justified by the experimental design (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013) included by-participant slopes for Pronoun and by-item intercepts. Item was defined as the combinations of names, images, and pronouns that varied across the 6 lists of characters; because these combinations did not fully vary across pronouns, by-item random slopes were not included. The final model (Table 3.2) included all interactions between fixed effects, plus by-item and by-participant intercepts (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Experiment 3: Production Accuracy, split by Nametag and Introduction conditions. Trials using no pronouns are excluded. By-participant means are shown as points; error bars indicate 95% CIs calculated over the by-participant means.\n\n\n\n\nAcross all conditions, participants were more likely to produce the correct pronoun than not (β = 13.16, z = 12.24, p &lt; .001). Participants were more accurate for he/him and she/her characters (M = 0.98 across Nametag and Introduction conditions) than for they/them characters (M = 0.88) (β = 5.05, z = 5.09, p &lt; .001). Within he/him and she/her trials, there was no significant difference between trials where the other pictured character used he/him or she/her and trials where the other character used they/them (β = -0.76, z = -1.61, p = .11). The main effects of Nametag and Introduction were not significant (β = 1.71, z = 1.54, p = .12; β = -0.80, z = -0.72, p = .47). The three-way interaction between Pronoun, Nametag, and Introduction was significant (β = 6.24, z = 3.91, p &lt; .001). This was qualified by significant interactions between Pronoun and Introduction (β = -2.58, z = -3.36, p &lt; .001), and Pronoun and Nametag (β = 2.32, z = 2.91, p &lt; .01). Post-hoc comparisons showed that Introduction attenuated the difference in accuracy between they/them and he/him + she/her in the –⁠Nametag conditions (β = -5.70, z = -6.92, p &lt; .001), but not in the +⁠Nametag conditions (β = 0.54, z = 0.41, p = .68). Figure 3.6 shows the means for each condition: accuracy for he/him and she/her characters was near ceiling for all conditions, and accuracy for they/them characters was highest in the –⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction condition (M = 0.95, SD = 0.21), slightly lower in the +⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction (M = 0.91, SD = 0.28) and +⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction (M = 0.91, SD = 0.29) conditions, and lowest in the –⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction condition (M = 0.73, SD = 0.44).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Experiment 3: Condition Means.

The trials were split in half, so that each half of the data included 5 he/him, 5 she/her, and 5 they/them characters for each participant. Pronoun was coded as 2 separate variables: the first comparing they/them (-.66) to he/him (+.33) and she/her (+.33) in even trials, with odd trials coded as 0, and the second comparing they/them to he/him + she/her in odd trials, with even trials coded as 0. The brms package in R (Bürkner, 2017) fit a model with the odd and even trial Pronoun variables as fixed effects predicting accuracy and as by-participant random slopes. The model kept the default priors and was fit using 4 chains, each with 4000 iterations, of which 2000 were warm-up. The random slope estimates represent the relative accuracy of they/them compared to he/him + she/her for each participant, and these estimates were strongly correlated between halves of the data, r = 0.97 [0.90, 1.00]. This matches the distribution of results for they/them characters (Figure 3.4B), where participants tended to produce singular they in all or nearly all trials, or in none.\nAfter confirming that the task showed high internal reliability, I conducted exploratory analyses with participant covariates that have previously been shown to correlate with acceptability ratings for singular they. For the sentence naturalness ratings (1–7 with 7 as “very natural”), the mean ratings for the generic, each, and every sentences [Indefinite Ratings] and for the 3 proper name sentences [Name Ratings] were calculated for each participant. For experience using they/them pronouns [Familiarity], participants were split into 3 similar-sized groups: had not heard about it before the study or had heard about it but hadn’t met anyone who does (N = 55); had met someone who uses they/them but weren’t close to them (N = 53); used they/them pronouns themself and/or were close to someone who uses they/them (N = 51). For familiarity with pronoun-sharing practices [Sharing], “none” and “never, because I had not heard about this” responses were coded as 0; “never, because I prefer not to” responses were coded as 1; “rarely” and “a few” responses were coded as 2; “sometimes” and “some” responses were coded as 3; “usually” and “most” responses were coded as 4; and “always” and “all” were coded as 5. These 4 questions were summed to create 1 composite score, with 0 indicating the lowest familiarity and 20 indicating the highest (M = 7.24, SD = 4.85). Responses for the gender binary and gender essentialism beliefs measure [Gender Beliefs] were rescaled from 1–7 to 0–6 and summed, with higher responses indicating stronger endorsement. Sexuality was coded as 1 for participants who said they were asexual, bisexual/pansexual, gay/lesbian, and/or queer (N = 38) and 0 otherwise (N = 121). Because only 6 participants said they were transgender and/or that their gender is different than their sex assigned at birth, analyzing this as a separate factor is difficult. Instead, LGBTQ+ Identity is treated as one variable, noting that the 6 TGD participants were also LGBQ+.\nThe strongest correlation between participant covariates (Figure 3.7) was familiarity with pronoun-sharing practices and familiarity with using they/them pronouns (r = 0.62, p &lt; .001), which is unsurprising given that people who use they/them nearly always have to explicitly state their pronouns in order to not be misgendered. The brief naturalness ratings questionnaire largely replicated prior results correlating gender beliefs, familiarity, LGBTQ+ identity, and age with judgments about singular they (Camilliere et al., 2021; Conrod, 2019; Hekanaho, 2020; Hernandez, 2020; Minkin & Brown, 2021; Nichols et al., 2019; Parker et al., 2019). The second-strongest correlation was between naturalness ratings and gender beliefs, with participants who more strongly endorsed the gender binary and gender essentialism rating singular they coreferring with proper names as less natural (r = -0.52, p &lt; .001) (see in particular Hernandez, 2020). LGBTQ+ participants (r = 0.30, p &lt; .001) and participants more familiar with using they/them (r = 0.33, p &lt; .001) and with pronoun-sharing practices (r = 0.38, p &lt; .001) rated they coreferring with proper names as more natural. Older participants rated it as less natural (r = -0.22, p &lt; .01). However, ratings for indefinite singular they (generic, each, every) were not significantly correlated with other participant covariates—or with ratings for they coreferring with proper names (r = 0.07, p = .40).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Experiment 3: Correlations Between Participant Covariates. Age, LGBTQ+ identity, familiarity with using they/them pronouns and pronoun-sharing practices, naturalness ratings for they coreferring with indefinite referents and with proper names.\n\n\n\n\nI then tested if adding these participant covariates to the hypothesis-testing model significantly contributed to fit. Age, Familiarity, Gender Beliefs, Name Ratings, and Sharing were mean-centered; and LGBTQ+ was mean-center effects coded. The distributions of the rescaled variables are shown in Figure A.9. The buildmer package in R (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023) was used to identify the most complex converging model, allowing all interactions between fixed effects. It then performed backwards stepwise elimination to remove participant covariate terms that did not significantly contribute to model fit, while retaining of the fixed and random effects from the hypothesis-testing model. The final model included Gender Beliefs, Familiarity, and a subset of their two- and three-way interactions (Table A.18). No effects of Familiarity were significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\nParticipants who more strongly endorsed the gender binary and gender essentialism were less accurate overall (β = -10.07, z = -3.44, p &lt; .001) and showed a larger relative difference in accuracy between they/them and he/him + she/her (β = 6.50, z = 3.53, p &lt; .001) (Figure 3.8). The interaction between Pronoun, Introduction, and Gender Beliefs was marginally significant after correction for multiple comparisons (β = 13.32, z = 3.11, p &lt; .01), such that Gender Beliefs had a larger effect on the relative accuracy of they/them in the –⁠Introduction conditions than in the +⁠Introduction conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Experiment 3: Accuracy by Gender Beliefs. By-participant mean accuracy for they/them characters, predicted by endorsement of the gender binary and gender essentialism.

    "text": "3.5 Discussion\nIn Experiment 3, participants learned about three characters, each of whom was associated with pronouns (1 he/him, 1 she/her, 1 they/them), a gender-neutral name, an image, and two sibling images. In all conditions, participants saw a total of five examples of each character’s pronouns in use before beginning the test trials. Additional information about the characters’ pronouns varied by two factors: the Introduction conditions manipulated whether the introductions to the characters explicitly stated who uses __ pronouns, and the Nametag conditions manipulated whether the images of the character included pronouns alongside their name. In each trial, participants saw two characters in the center, with their four siblings in the corners. An object moved from a character to a sibling, prompting spoken descriptions in the frame Jaime gave the apple to their brother (Pozzan & Antón-Méndez, 2017). This structure preferentially elicited—but did not require—participants to produce a possessive pronoun.\nBaseline accuracy for they/them characters was high compared to the first two experiments, with participants in the –⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction condition correctly producing singular they in about three quarters of trials. Both the nametag and introduction manipulations facilitated singular they, with accuracy in conditions with one or both rising to over 90%. Accuracy for they/them characters was, unexpectedly, highest in the –⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction condition and slightly lower in the +⁠Nametag +⁠Introduction and +⁠Nametag –⁠Introduction conditions. Generally, the Nametag and Introduction conditions tended to affect whether or not participants used singular they at all, with the majority of participants producing singular they in all or nearly all trials, or in no trials.\nThe original goal of this experiment was to investigate how introductions and nametags may reduce the number of errors speakers make—potentially mirroring the real-life situation where well-intentioned people do get they/them pronouns correct, but only when paying attention to it, and will frequently default back to he/him or she/her when the demands of the conversation direct their attention elsewhere. The speech production task proved relatively easy for participants, since they did not have to remember names for the characters and their siblings, the trial pacing erred on the side of not requiring them to rush, and the objects were typically easy to name. While it would not have been possible to conceal the fact that the experiment is about pronouns, it is likely that producing pronouns was the most difficult aspect of the task, and that participants were able to focus their attention on it. From this perspective, the task proved too easy for participants.\nHowever, the all-or-nothing distribution of responses means that the task showed high internal reliability, warranting individual differences analyses. Participants were recruited from Prolific and had a wide range of experience using they/them pronouns, naturalness ratings for various forms of singular they (Conrod, 2019), experiences with pronoun-sharing practices, and beliefs about the gender binary and gender essentialism (Nagoshi et al., 2008). This experiment replicates the expected relationships between acceptability judgments for they coreferring with proper names. Age and endorsement of the gender binary negatively correlated with naturalness ratings, and LGBTQ+ identity, experience with they/them, and familiarity with pronoun-sharing positively correlated with naturalness ratings (Camilliere et al., 2021; Conrod, 2019; Hekanaho, 2020; Hernandez, 2020; Minkin & Brown, 2021; Parker et al., 2019). However, when testing if adding participant covariates to the hypothesis-testing model improved fit, acceptability ratings did not predict production accuracy. Instead, gender beliefs was the strongest predictor of accuracy for they/them characters, with participants who more strongly endorsed the gender binary and gender essentialism and expressed more discomfort with gender non-conforming people being less likely to use singular they.\nCollecting speech production data online came with both advantages and drawbacks. Compared to in-lab experiments, recruiting participants on Prolific resulted in a sample more diverse in age, language experience, and sociopolitical beliefs (Douglas et al., 2023), as well as the ability to collect enough data to be appropriately powered. The fact that participants never interacted directly with an experimenter means that social desirability pressures may have been different. While it was clear that the experiment wanted them to use they/them pronouns, speakers may feel differently about refusing or failing to do so when an addressee is present. How the social context—either another participant completing the same task, or a researcher who participants may infer is LGBTQ+ and is invested in the outcome of the experiment—is an area for future research.\n\n\n\n\nAnsara, Y.

    "text": "4.1 Motivation\nOne of the most common objections to singular they is that both generic and specific forms are too ambiguous (Hekanaho, 2020). However, it is unclear whether this opinion arises from actual difficulties in coreference resolution, or if it is more a product of language and gender attitudes. According to the processing fluency account (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2009), processing difficulty and language attitudes are connected both directly and indirectly. First, processing fluency can be a cue to language attitudes: if a listener attributes their difficulty understanding a speaker to that speaker being unable or unwilling to communicate in a way that the listener finds clear, experiencing less processing fluency will cause them to evaluate the speaker more negatively. Second, harder processing tends to elicit more negative affect, which may bias listeners’ language attitudes (Dragojevic, 2020). One line of experiments has connected the processing fluency account specifically to perceptions of nonnative-accented speech. Participants listened to audio recordings of fictional stories, and while their task was ostensibly to remember enough of the story to complete a fill-in-the-blanks memory task, the dependent measures were how much processing fluency they experienced (e.g., rating as clear, easy to understand), how positively they felt about the speaker (1‍–‍100 scale), and status (e.g., intelligence, competence) and solidarity (e.g., friendliness, niceness) judgments about the speaker. The experiments manipulated various ways of making the audio easier or harder to understand, independent of the speaker’s accent. Adding background white noise to the audio decreased listeners’ fluency ratings when the speaker used a Punjabi accent, more so than when the same speaker used a Standard American English accent. The lower processing fluency then resulted in more negative affect and lower status attributions to the speaker. When a Mandarin-accented speaker was accompanied with subtitles or participants had read a transcript of the story first, participants reported higher processing fluency, which resulted in more positive feelings about and higher status attributions to the speaker. In both sets of experiments, the effects of making the listening conditions easier or harder on status attributions were mediated by processing fluency and sequentially by fluency and affect (Dragojevic et al., 2017; Dragojevic, 2020; Dragojevic & Giles, 2016).\nThe processing fluency account would predict that dislike of singular they is caused, at least in part, by lower-level processing difficulty. Multiple factors could cause listeners to experience lower processing fluency for singular they compared to other pronouns: a larger set of possible antecedents may make it more ambiguous, it may elicit a number or gender mismatch agreement violation, it may be newly learned, and it is overall less frequent even for speakers familiar with it. The processing fluency account also predicts that making singular they easier to understand would reduce people’s negative reactions to it, and therefore the people who use it.\nHowever, the actual amount of processing difficulty for singular they—particularly for definite specific gender-specified forms—is unclear. Only a few studies to date have investigated online comprehension of they coreferring with proper names. These are described in more detail in the Section 0.4.4, but to review briefly, people are slower to identify the referent for they compared to he and she, as measured through a maze task while reading (Shenkar et al., 2023) and a mouse tracking task while listening (Arnold et al., 2023). In two ERP experiments, a P600 effect was observed for they coreferring with proper names (gender-specified), but not with specific gender-unspecified referents (e.g., the participant) (Chen et al., 2023; Prasad & Morris, 2020). Since the P600 indexes detecting a syntactic error or having difficulty comprehending a sentence’s syntactic structure (Hagoort et al., 1993; Kaan et al., 2000; Osterhout et al., 1994; Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992), Prasad & Morris interpret their results to indicate that they coreferring with proper names still causes a gender agreement error, even though participants in their experiment all had significant experience with using they/them pronouns and considered it grammatical in offline acceptability judgments.\nHowever, results like Prasad & Morris (2020) do not necessarily require that they for specific gender-specified antecedents is still ungrammatical for these participants. Even in LGBTQ+ communities, they coreferring with a name is still relatively infrequent overall and would not be expected in many contexts. Stimuli in sentence processing experiments are typically unrelated, with each sentence using a different name and referring to a new character. When singular they corefers with a new referent in each trial, it is unclear whether they is consistently perceived as syntactically anomalous, or if it is originally unexpected, but could be processed smoothly once anticipated to corefer with a particular referent. Experiment 4 tests processing in the context of repeated reference, where listeners can come to expect singular they to corefer with certain characters. This is potentially somewhat easier, and it more closely resembles the real-world contexts in which we hear pronouns referring to people.\nAdditionally, the majority of processing studies, particularly for generic indefinite they, have used self-paced reading and eyetracking while reading measures. Experiment 4 is one of the first to use the visual world paradigm, which measures eye movements while participants listen to sentences describing a visual scene. Gaze at pictured characters provides a measure of online processing as the sentence unfolds, since listeners automatically look at what they think is being talked about (Allopenna et al., 1998; Sedivy et al., 1999; Spivey et al., 2002; Tanenhaus et al., 1995, 2000). The visual world paradigm has advantages compared to other tasks, as it provides detailed time-course information about which alternative interpretations are being considered, in addition to when processing difficulties occur.\nExperiment 4 investigates the degree of processing difficulty of singular they compared to he and she, if the processing of singular they follows the same patterns as he and she, and if processing measures correspond with offline judgments. The design is based on a prior line of work investigating ambiguous pronoun resolution. In Arnold et al. (2000, 2007), participants looked at illustrated scenes of cartoon characters and listened to stories about them:\n\n1 Donald is bringing some mail to Mickey/Minnie, while a violent storm is beginning\n2 He’s/She’s carrying an\n3 umbrella and it looks like they’re both going to need it.\n\nPart 1 introduced 2 named characters (Donald, Mickey/Minnie), using a verb (bringing) that allows for a subsequent pronoun to refer to either of the characters individually (Garnham, 2001; Gordon et al., 1993; Sanford & Garrod, 1981). While he or she (part 2) is more likely to refer to the character mentioned first in the prior sentence (Donald) (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Gernsbacher, 1989; Kaiser & Trueswell, 2011), it can also refer to the character mentioned second (Mickey/Minnie). In other words, the character mentioned first is more accessible (Ariel, 2006). This structure makes it possible for the referent of he or she—called the target character in visual world experiments—to remain ambiguous until the next phrase (part 3) can be compared to the illustration. In this example, either Donald or Mickey/Minnie is carrying an umbrella (Figure 4.1A). This allows for enough time to observe processing of the pronoun (is carrying an), but without creating a discourse context too different from actual language use.\nThe stories in Arnold et al. (2000) manipulated 2 factors: the ambiguity of the pronoun (target and competitor characters using the same vs different pronouns) and the accessibility of the referent (target mentioned first vs second). The results showed that listeners rapidly use both gender and accessibility cues to identify which character the pronoun referred to (Figure 4.1B). If gender was unambiguous (top right in Figure 4.1A), the pronoun referred to the character mentioned first (bottom left), or both (top left), participants looked at the target character starting at approximately 200ms after the pronoun. This is about as quickly as effects in the visual world paradigm can be observed (Hallett, 1986; Tanenhaus et al., 1995). When neither gender nor accessibility cues disambiguated the referent (bottom right), participants looked at the target and competitor characters almost equally. For the purposes of the present experiment, these results provide a validated stimuli design and a baseline for how we expect he and she to be processed.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Arnold et al. (2000). [A] Recreation of design, showing the pronoun ambiguity and order of mention conditions. The original materials were illustrated using the Disney characters. [B] Results, with 0 indicating pronoun onset and horizontal lines indicating the verb (carrying).\n\n\nA later set of studies used a similar design to examine how listeners process pronouns acoustically ambiguous between he and she (Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017; Falandays et al., 2020). This experiment used similar stories as Arnold et al. (2000, 2007), but different images. Instead of 2 characters being drawn to match the scene, characters were pictured in colored shapes. The target character was disambiguated by describing their location, e.g., he’s standing on a blue square instead of he’s carrying an umbrella. This allows for a larger range of stimuli to be created, and the prior results demonstrate that listeners can process he and she smoothly in these types of stories. Critically, while the descriptions may seem odd and somewhat discontinuous, the discourse structure matches how speakers introduce new referents and when they tend to use pronouns instead of names.\nThe current experiment uses similar manipulations as Arnold et al. (2000, 2007) and the same task as Brown-Schmidt & Toscano (2017). One potential issue with this design is that they can be ambiguous between a singular and plural interpretation, even if participants learn that they is always singular in the context of the experiment. An alternative is to use stimuli that rule out a plural interpretation of they. Reflexive pronouns (himself, herself, themself) can syntactically constrain a singular interpretation (e.g., Runner et al., 2006; Sturt, 2003), but introduce a potential confound, since speakers vary in whether they prefer themself or themselves for singular referents (Ahn & Conrod, 2022). Another option is to use stimuli that semantically rule out a plural interpretation. Returning to some of the examples in the first chapter (Section 0.2.3), they’re worrying (Example 6) can be singular or plural, since people can worry together, but their free leg (Example 7) can only be singular, since a body part only belongs to one person. However, it is difficult to create stimuli that rule out a plural interpretation, while still including a long enough period where the pronoun is ambiguous between two possible referents. Results like these would be difficult to interpret because it would be unclear whether processing costs are due to singular they itself, or because the structure of the story does not match when speakers use pronouns instead of names or other referring expressions. Moreover, because fully ruling out a plural interpretation is difficult, the majority of instances of singular they in actual language use do contain some degree of ambiguity between singular and plural interpretations. Results from stimuli that reflect a very narrow set of contexts in which people hear singular they, where no plural interpretation is at all possible, would be less relevant."

Sources and attributions for the images are included with the materials; the edited images and audio stimuli are available upon request. The de-identified data and analysis code are available at this dissertation’s Github repository.\n\n4.2.1 Participants\n30 participants completed the study for partial course credit or for pay; their demographic information is shown in Table 4.1. Participants were required to be fluent English speakers (but not necessarily native or monolingual) and to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, and most were Vanderbilt undergraduate students. An additional 2 participants completed the experiment, but were excluded due to too few trials having usable eyetracking data. The experiment lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\n\n4.2.2 Materials\n\nCharacters\nParticipants learned about 6 characters, each associated with a name and an image: 2 who used he/him, 2 who used she/her, and 2 who used they/them (Figure 4.2A). The 6 character names and 6 character images were the same as in Experiment 3 (Drucker, 2019). Recall that all names were gender neutral since counterbalancing gender associations of the names within lists was not feasible. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 lists, in order to counterbalance the images and names associated with characters who use they/them. Across lists, 3 images appeared twice with he/him and once with they/them, and 3 images appeared twice with she/her and once with they/them; each name appeared twice with each pronoun. Critically, across lists they/them appeared once with each image and once with each name, in order to avoid confounding interpretations about what aspects of a person’s name or appearance may make it easier for someone to learn that they use they/them pronouns.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Experiment 4: Stimuli. [A] Example set of characters. [B] Example trial screen and story, with grey boxes indicating information not shown to participants.\n\n\n\n\nStories\nThe stories and visual scenes were based on Arnold et al. (2000) Arnold et al. (2007) and Brown-Schmidt & Toscano (2017). During each trial, the 6 characters were arranged in a 3x2 grid, each shown inside a colored shape (red, yellow, green, blue; triangle, square) (Figure 4.2B). Participants listened to stories in the frame:\n\n1 Jaime is painting a portrait of Sam, as some paint is spilling on the floor.\n2 He is/she is/they are\n3 standing in a blue triangle\n4 and the painting looks amazing\n\nEach story began with a sentence that named two characters, with an additional phrase to allow time for participants to identify them (part 1). The two named characters—the target and competitor—always used different pronouns (e.g., Jaime: they/them, Sam: he/him). This created 3 Pronoun Pair conditions: they/them targets with he/him or she/her competitors [They|HeShe], he/him or she/her targets with they/them competitors [HeShe|They], and he/him or she/her targets with he/him or she/her competitors [HeShe|SheHe]. Next, a pronoun (he, she, or they) referred to one of the named characters (part 2). This created 2 Order of Mention conditions, where the pronoun refers to the character mentioned first in the preceding sentence or to the character mentioned second. Figure 4.2B shows an example of the first-mention condition, where the pronoun (they) refers to the first named character (Jaime). The second-mention story matching this scene would have he is standing in a blue triangle, where he refers to Sam.\nAt this point in the story, participants could identify which of the named characters is the target if they knew the characters’ pronouns and were using that information in their language comprehension (e.g., Jaime uses they/them and Sam uses he/him, meaning that they refers to Jaime). The stories then described the location of the target character (part 3). Because the target and competitor characters were always pictured with the same color, the target was not fully disambiguated until the shape word, an average of 1364ms after the pronoun onset. After the shape word (part 3), listeners could identify the target character without taking the pronoun into consideration. The story concluded with a final phrase, which did not include another pronoun referring to the character(s) (part 4). After listening to each story, participants were asked to decide whether it matched the scene (e.g., if Jaime was standing in a blue square).\nThere were a total of 60 story frames (1 + 4). Within lists, each story appeared once in the first-mention condition and once in the second-mention condition. Across lists, each story appeared twice with each pronoun for counterbalancing, but with the same pair of names to make the stimuli recording feasible. There were a total of 24 pronoun + color + shape combinations (2 + 3). These clips were recorded as full sentences (not spliced together), and each trial randomly selected 1 of 3 versions, in order to avoid participants learning additional cues about a particular recording. The audio was recorded by the first author, a white native English speaker from the northeast U.S. with a feminine voice.\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Procedure\n\nCharacter Learning\nTo learn about the characters, participants first saw each character’s image, accompanied by their name (e.g., This is Jaime) and a fact about them (e.g., They like to play the piano, They work as an engineer). Each character was shown twice, so that participants saw two examples of the characters’ pronouns. However, pronouns were never directly stated (e.g., This is Jaime, who uses they/them pronouns), and the use of singular they was not explained to participants. Participants were then tested on the names and images of the characters. They were shown all 6 images and asked to click on the named character. If the answer was correct, the image and name of the character was displayed, along with another example of their pronouns (e.g., Correct, they’re Jaime). If the answer was incorrect, the image of and information about the incorrectly chosen character was shown (e.g., Incorrect, he’s Sam), followed by the image of and information about the correct character (e.g., They’re Jaime). To continue, participants were required to get all 6 names correct in the same block. When listening to the stories, participants should then have been able to identify the images of the 2 named characters, and had seen at least 3 examples of each characters’ pronouns.\n\n\nEyetracking\nDuring each trial, the images were displayed for 1 second, then the audio began playing. After the story finished, the images remained on the screen, and the text Did the story match the picture? was displayed at the bottom. Participants clicked YES or NO at the corner of the screen to advance to the next trial. Eye movements were recorded with an Eyelink 1000 desktop-mounted eyetracker recording monocularly at 1000 Hz, with drift correction after every fifth trial. The trial order was randomly generated for each participant, the locations of the 6 images were randomly generated for each trial, and the colors and shapes were counterbalanced.\nParticipants completed 6 practice trials in order to explain the task and that they should judge whether the story matched the scene based on the colored shape sentence, since the action described at the beginning (e.g., painting a portrait) was not pictured. These practice trials used a name instead of a pronoun (e.g., Jaime is standing in a blue triangle). 4 trials matched the scene, and 2 trials mismatched by referring to a color not pictured. After each practice trial, participants saw feedback on if their match judgment was correct.\nParticipants then completed 96 critical and 18 filler trials, mixed in a randomized order. These varied according to 2 within-subjects factors: Pronoun Pair [They|HeShe; HeShe|They; HeShe|SheHe] and Order of Mention [target mentioned first; second]. The target and competitor characters were evenly distributed, yielding a total of 32 critical trials for each pronoun. Filler trials were included to ensure that participants treated no as an option in the match judgment question, even if they considered singular they acceptable and knew which characters used they/them. 10 of the filler trials were unambiguously the wrong description, referring to a color that was not pictured on the screen (e.g., for Figure 4.2B, they are standing in a red square). The other 8 filler trials used one of the pronouns of the non-named characters, making the story incorrect for the target character, as well as the competitor character (e.g., for Figure 4.2B, she is standing in a blue triangle). The he/him and she/her characters were each called they twice, and the they/them characters were each called he once and she once. No filler trials used he instead of she or she instead of he. Note that throughout the experiment, they was always singular, never plural. After completing the 120 trials, participants were tested on the names of the characters, following the same procedure as before, but without feedback.\n\n\nSurvey\nFinally, participants completed the same singular they naturalness ratings, familiarity with using they/them pronouns, gender binary and gender essentialism beliefs (survey), and demographics questions as in Experiment 3. All demographic questions included the option to not respond. Figure 4.3 shows an overview of the full procedure.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Experiment 4: Procedure."

    "text": "4.3 Predictions\nThe first question concerns whether listeners can accurately comprehend they as singular, then combine this with knowledge about the character’s pronouns to identify who is being described in the story. If so, participants will preferentially look at the target character after the pronoun and before the disambiguating shape word. While it is theoretically possible that singular they would show no processing costs compared to he or she, prior results indicate this is currently unlikely (Arnold et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Prasad & Morris, 2020; Sanford & Filik, 2007; Shenkar et al., 2023). Instead, listeners may identify the referent for singular they before the disambiguation, but more slowly than they do for he and she. This result would resemble those observed in young children (Arnold et al., 2007; Song & Fisher, 2005) and in adult second language learners (Cunnings et al., 2017; Grüter et al., 2012; Speyer & Schleef, 2019), who can use gender and order of mention cues from pronouns to identify the referent, but do so more slowly than fluent adults. Alternatively, there are two ways of observing results where listeners do not preferentially look at the target before the disambiguating shape word, which the current experiment cannot distinguish between. One possibility is that listeners attempt to use singular they to identify the target character, but do not succeed because of ambiguity. Another possibility is that listeners recognize the potential ambiguity in they and strategically choose to wait until hearing more information before deciding on an interpretation.\nA secondary question concerns the competitor character, who is named at the beginning of the story but whose pronouns are never used. Stories using he and she can have a competitor who uses she/her or he/him (never the same as the target character), or a competitor who uses they/them. A difference between these two conditions could be predicted in either direction: If trials where the competitor character uses they/them are slower than trials where the competitor character uses he/him or she/her, this could indicate that some aspect of the they/them characters—the pronoun activated alongside the character or the character themself—is causing greater competition (making it a stronger possibility) than the he/him and she/her characters. If, on the other hand, trials where the competitor character uses they/them are faster, this could indicate that listeners are treating the more ambiguous character as less likely to be referred to, either in general or with a pronoun.\nWith regards to order of mention, we expect to replicate prior results for he and she, where participants are more likely to look at target characters who were named first than target characters who were named second, because although the pronoun can refer to either, it is more likely to refer to the person mentioned first (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017). If we also observe an order of mention effect for singular they—either the same as or present but reduced compared to he and she—it would suggest that singular they is being integrated into listeners’ standard discourse processing mechanisms."

    "section": "4.4 Results",
    "text": "4.4 Results\n\n4.4.1 Participant Backgrounds\nTo contextualize the findings, I first discuss the results of the survey. Most participants were in the typical undergraduate age range (M = 20.13, SD = 2.61) and described themselves as native English speakers (N = 27). 19 were women, 11 were men, and none identified as transgender and/or a gender different than their sex assigned at birth (Table 4.1). Overall, all participants were at least somewhat familiar with singular they before the experiment: 5 had heard about people using they/them pronouns but not met anyone who does, 21 had met but were not close to anyone who uses they/them, and 9 were close to someone who uses they/them, but 0 participants used they/them themselves (Figure 4.4B). When rating the naturalness of singular they coreferring with different types of referents (Figure 4.4A), acceptance of indefinite forms was generally high (M = 5.17, SD = 1.76). Surprisingly, ratings for proper names (M = 4.98, SD = 1.66) were not significantly lower than ratings for indefinites (β = 0.19, t = 0.36, p = .73) (Table A.20). For the gender beliefs measure (Nagoshi et al., 2008), responses were again scaled to 0–6 and summed, so that a score of 0 indicated the lowest endorsement of the gender binary and gender essentialism, and a score of 54 indicated the highest Figure 4.4C. Participant totals spanned the entire range but were strongly skewed towards the lower end, with the mean response favorable towards trans and gender-nonconforming people (range = 1–53, M = 13.93, SD = 12.56) (see Table A.19 for item text and means).\n\n\nTable 4.1: Experiment 4: Participant demographics. Categories with higher totals allowed participants to select as many options as applied. All questions included the option to not respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 4: Participant DemographicsAge3018-242625-34435-44045-54055-64065-74075+0Prefer not to answer / Missing data0Gender30Female19Male11Prefer not to answer / Missing data0Transgender & Gender-Diverse47I consider myself cisgender17I consider myself transgender0I don't consider myself cisgender or transgender0My gender is the same as what was written on my original birth certificate30My gender is different than what was written on my original birth certificate0Prefer not to answer / Missing data0Sexuality34Asexual1Bisexual/Pansexual3Gay/Lesbian1Heterosexual/Straight27Queer0Questioning2I use a different term0Prefer not to answer / Missing data0English Experience30Native (learned from birth)27Fully competent in speaking, listening, reading, and writing, but not native3Prefer not to answer / Missing data0Race/Ethnicity34American Indian or Alaska Native0Asian10Black, African American, or African1Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish6Middle Eastern or North African1Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander0White15I use a different term0Prefer not to answer / Missing data0Prefer not to answer1Total Participants30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Experiment 4: Prior Familiarity and Attitudes Survey.

The mean response is indicated by the black line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Offline Measures\n\nCharacter Learning\nParticipants were generally able to learn the name-image pairs within 2–3 test rounds (M = 2.33, SD = 1.09). Across all pretest rounds, accuracies for they/them characters (M = 0.81, SD = 0.40) and she/her characters (M = 0.83, SD = 0.38) were slightly lower than accuracy for he/him characters (M = 0.90, SD = 0.30). Participants remembered the names of the characters throughout the study, with most (N = 27) getting all 6 correct in the post-test, and no participants excluded for getting 4 or fewer correct.\n\n\nMatch Judgments\nWhen asked if the description they heard matched the scene (Figure 4.5, left), participants correctly judged the majority of test trials to be matching. The match rates for singular they trials (M = 0.91) were not significantly lower than the match rates for he and she trials (MHeShe|They = 0.91, MHeShe|SheHe = 0.94) (Table A.21). For the wrong description trials, which referred to a color that was not pictured, participants were correctly at floor for all pronouns. For the wrong pronoun trials, which used the pronoun that neither of the two named characters used, participants varied. However, they were not less likely to indicate a mismatch when they/them characters were referred to with he or she (M = 0.44) than when he/him or she/her characters were referred to with they (M = 0.43) (Table A.22).\nReaction times were calculated from the display of the match question until the participant’s click, with responses outside of 3SD of the mean of each trial type excluded as outliers (Figure 4.5, right). Similar to the accuracy data, reaction times were shortest for wrong description trials (M = 2917ms, SD = 2360ms), somewhat longer for test trials (M = 3544ms, SD = 3369ms), and longest and most variable for wrong pronoun trials (M = 4995ms, SD = 3996ms). An inverse Gaussian distribution with an identity link was fit to test whether Pronoun Pair affected reaction time in the test trials (Table A.23). This accounts for the non-normal distribution of reaction time data, but in contrast to applying a non-linear transformation (e.g., log), it maintains the theoretical assumption that experimental manipulations affect the total amount of time to make a decision (Lo & Andrews, 2015). The maximal model that converged included by-participant and by-item intercepts and slopes for Pronoun Pair (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023). Participants were slower to make match judgments for stories using singular they than stories using he and she (β = -506.67, t = -12.40, p &lt; .001). The pronoun of the competitor character did not affect reaction times (β = 32.96, t = 0.75, p = .45).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Experiment 4: By-participant mean proportions of stories judged to match the picture (left) and reaction times (right). Lines indicate by-participant means between Pronoun Pair conditions; violins indicate the distribution of by-participant means; point ranges indicate condition means and 95% CIs calculated over the by-participant means. The correct answers are match (=1) for test trials and mismatch (=0) for wrong pronoun and wrong description trials. For the wrong description trials, he/him or she/her for a they/them character corresponds to the HeShe|SheHe condition; they/them for a he/him or she/her character corresponds to the They|HeShe condition; and there were no wrong pronoun trials for the HeShe|They condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Online Processing\nFigure 4.6 shows fixations to the target, competitor, distractor, and no characters, starting 500ms before the onset of the pronoun and continuing for 2500ms (e.g., …spilling on the floor. They are standing in a blue triangle, and the painting looks amazing). The He|She and She|He trials (first row) generally resemble prior results (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017), with participants starting to look at the target more than the competitor rapidly after the onset of the pronoun, and more so when the target character was mentioned first. Unexpectedly, the order of mention effect—where listeners look more at the character named first in the story than to the character named second—is only clear in He|She trials, not in She|He trials. The He|They and She|They trials (second row) show the expected order effect, but participants are less likely to be looking at the target than in the He|She and She|He trials. The They|He and They|She trials (third row) still show participants looking at the target more than the competitor before the onset of the shape word, but less than in the other two conditions, and no order effect is apparent. Examining fixations during the beginning of the story (Figure A.10), participants looked at the target and competitor after each was named, and the time course did not differ by the character’s pronouns. This confirms that participants knew the names of the characters and had identified the two possible referents before the start of the critical time window.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Experiment 4: Eyetracking: Full Window. Proportions of looks to the target, competitor, distractor (average of 4), and no characters, split by target pronoun, competitor pronoun, and order of mention conditions. The gray box indicates the analysis region, starting 200ms after pronoun onset and ending at 1210ms, the earliest shape word onset across stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary analysis window, shown in grey in Figure 4.6, was offset by 200ms after the onset of the pronoun, the estimated time it takes to plan and execute a saccade in response to the auditory stimulus (Hallett, 1986). It continued until 1210ms after the pronoun onset, which was the earliest shape word onset across all of the stimuli (range = 1216–1790ms, M = 1364ms, SD = 103ms). Results were analyzed with dynamic generalized mixed-effects models, predicting whether participants looked at the target character (=1) or not (=0) at each time point (Brown-Schmidt et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2018). Observations were down-sampled to 10ms bins, where bins that included &gt;5ms of a fixation on or a saccade to the target (McMurray et al., 2009, 2019) were coded as 1, bins that included &lt;5ms were coded as 0, and bins that included 5ms were coded as 1 if they followed a bin that was coded as 1 and 0 if not. Aside from this, the data was not aggregated across trials or participants. The model included a fixed effect for Trend (timestep during trial, mean-centered) to capture linear changes across the trial in the level of fixations to the target. To account for autocorrelation between time points, the model included an AR(1) term, which captures whether the participant was looking at the target in the prior timestep. To calculate AR(1) for the start of the analysis window, timesteps for 180ms and 190ms were included in the data, and then the first timestep with missing data for AR(1) was excluded prior to estimation, resulting in 103 data points for each trial.\nThe fixed effect of Pronoun Pair was coded with orthogonal Helmert contrasts, with the first contrast comparing trials with they target characters to trials with he or she target characters (They|HeShe vs HeShe|They + HeShe|SheHe), and the second contrast comparing trials with he or she target and they competitor characters to trials with he or she target and she or he competitor characters (HeShe|They vs HeShe|SheHe). The fixed effect of Order was mean-center effects coded, comparing trials where the target character was mentioned second to trials where the target character was mentioned first. Figure 4.7 shows the proportion of looks to the target and competitor characters during the analysis window, comparing the 3 Pronoun Pair and 2 Order of Mention conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Experiment 4: Eyetracking: Analysis Window. Proportion of looks to target, competitor, distractor (average of 4), and no characters, comparing between the 3 pronoun pair and 2 order of mention conditions. The window starts 200ms after pronoun onset and ends at 1210ms, the earliest shape word onset across stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nThe maximal random effects structure (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013) included by-participant and by-item slopes for Pronoun Pair, Order, AR(1), Trend (time point during trial), and Trial Number (time point during experiment), with items defined as the 60 story frames that named the 2 characters. The lme4 and buildmer packages in R identified the most complex random effects structure that would converge (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023), which included by-participant slopes for AR, Order, and Trial Number and by-item slopes for Order and Trend (Table 4.2).\nThe AR(1) effect was significant (β = 9.97, z = 91.37, p &lt; .001), reflecting the fact that participants were more likely to be looking at the target during the current timestep if they had been looking at the target during the previous timestep. Trend was not significant (β = 0.05, z = 1.37, p = .17), indicating that the overall level of target fixations did not significantly increase or decrease in a linear fashion over the course of the trial.\nBoth contrasts for Pronoun Pair were significant: Participants were more likely to look at the target character after the onset of he and she than after the onset of they, across Order conditions (β = 0.28, z = 6.00, p &lt; .001). After the onset of he or she, participants were more likely to look at the target character if the competitor character used he/him or she/her than if the competitor character used they/them (β = 0.28, z = 5.16, p &lt; .001). Visual inspection of the data shows that in stories using he and she, looks to the target diverge from looks to the competitor and reach a proportion of 0.5 in the first quarter of the analysis window. In stories using they, looks to the target diverge from looks to the competitor in the first quarter of the analysis window, but do not reach 0.5 until the last quarter (Figure 4.7).\nIn the primary model, the main effect of Order was not significant, indicating that listeners were not more likely to be looking at target characters mentioned first than target characters mentioned second (β = 0.08, z = 1.06, p = .29). Both interactions of Order with Pronoun Pair were nonsignificant (They|HeShe vs HeShe|They + HeShe|SheHe: β = 0.14, z = 1.52, p = .13; HeShe|They vs HeShe|SheHe: β = -0.18, z = -1.65, p = .10). The lack of an order effect was a surprise, given that this was a robust result in prior research using a similar paradigm (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017). Post-hoc models explored the order of mention effect in each condition separately (Table A.24, Table A.25, Table A.26). These analyses revealed a significant effect of Order in the HeShe|They condition (β = 0.22, z = 2.20, p &lt; .05), but not in the HeShe|SheHe (β = 0.05, z = 0.47, p = .64) or They|HeShe conditions (β = 0.00, z = -0.03, p = .97).\nAfter noting differences between the He|She and She|He trials in Figure 4.6, an exploratory analysis tested the effect of Target Pronoun. As in previous experiments, it was coded with orthogonal Helmert contrasts, with the first contrast comparing they/them to he/him + she/her target trials, and the second contrast comparing she/her to he/him target trials. The comparison between he and she trials was not significant (β = 0.04, z = 0.73, p = .47) (Table A.27). Additional exploratory analyses tested if Trend and AR(1) interacted with Pronoun Pair and Order, finding no significant effects in addition to those reported in the main model (Table A.28, Table A.29).\n\n\nTable 4.2: Experiment 4: Model results for the effects of Pronoun Pair, Order, AR(1), and Trend on the likelihood of looking at the target character (=1) or not (=0).\n\n\nExperiment 4: Looks to the Target Character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLooks to Target\n\n\nPredictors\nLog-Odds\nSE\nz\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-4.715\n0.084\n-56.037\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nAR(1) (0, 1)\n9.973\n0.109\n91.367\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun Pair: They|HeShe (-.66) vsHeShe|They  (+.33) + HeShe|SheHe (+.33)\n0.282\n0.047\n6.004\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPronoun Pair: HeShe|They (-.5) vsHeShe|SheHe (+.5)\n0.277\n0.054\n5.158\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nOrder: Target Mentioned Second (-.5) vs First (+.5)\n0.084\n0.079\n1.059\n0.290\n\n\nTrend (mean-centered)\n0.052\n0.038\n1.370\n0.171\n\n\nPronoun Pair (They|HeShe vs HeShe|They +HeShe|SheHe) * Order\n0.143\n0.094\n1.521\n0.128\n\n\nPronoun Pair (HeShe|They vs HeShe|SheHe) * Order\n-0.177\n0.107\n-1.651\n0.099\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\n\nτ00 Story\n0.007\n\n\nτ00 Participant\n0.196\n\n\nτ11 Order | Story\n0.024\n\n\nτ11 Trend | Story\n0.005\n\n\nτ11 AR(1) | Participant\n0.271\n\n\nτ11 Order | Participant\n0.112\n\n\nτ11 Trial Number | Participant\n0.025\n\n\nρ01 Order | Story\n0.964\n\n\nρ01 Trend | Story\n0.214\n\n\nρ01 AR(1) | Participant\n-0.299\n\n\nρ01 Order | Participant\n0.091\n\n\nρ01 Trial Number | Participant\n0.527\n\n\nN Participant\n30\n\n\nN Story\n60\n\nObservations\n296022"

    "text": "4.5 Discussion\nExperiment 4 tested online processing of singular they coreferring with proper names, in a context where listeners can come to anticipate it for certain referents. Participants learned about two he/him, two she/her, and two they/them characters and passed a pretest to ensure that they learned the mappings between the names and images. In the eyetracking trials, each of the six characters was pictured in a colored shape. The stories named two characters—always a pair with different pronouns—and used a verb that allows an upcoming pronoun to refer to either of the named characters (e.g., Jaime is painting a portrait of Sam, as some paint is spilling on the floor). The pronoun phrase described the target character’s location (e.g., They are standing in a blue triangle), leaving about 1200ms between the onset of the pronoun and the onset of the disambiguating shape word to measure how listeners used the pronoun to identify the target character. Trials varied by two within-participants conditions: the pronouns of the two named characters (HeShe|SheHe, HeShe|They, They|HeShe) and whether the pronoun referred to the character mentioned first or second.\nVisual inspection of the data suggests that listeners do comprehend they as singular and use this information to identify which character is being referred to, just to a lesser degree than with he and she. Looks to the target diverged from looks to the competitor at about 500ms after the onset of they, compared to about 200ms after the onset of he or she. This is similar to the patterns seen in young children (Arnold et al., 2007; Song & Fisher, 2005) and in adult second language learners (Cunnings et al., 2017; Grüter et al., 2012; Speyer & Schleef, 2019). Singular they, however, did not show an order of mention effect, suggesting that listeners may be using different cues to disambiguate singular they from plural they than when he or she could refer to multiple referents (e.g., if both of the named characters used he/him). After each trial, participants judged whether the story matched the scene, and they were not less likely to say that stories used singular they matched, but their responses were slower than for he and she.\nEven though the competitor character’s pronouns were never used in a given story, they did affect processing. Within he and she trials, listeners were less likely to be looking at the target character when the competitor character used they/them than when the competitor character used she/her or he/him. One explanation is that participants were paying more attention in general to the they/them characters, since they were atypical or more difficult, or because they were inferred to be the goal of the study. Examining the fixations during the 1000ms where the screen was displayed before the audio started (Figure A.11) and during the first phrase when the two characters were named (Figure A.10) rules out this explanation, because participants were not more likely to be looking at the they/them characters than the he/him and she/her characters during either window.\nOne unexpected result is that the he and she trials did not entirely replicate the order of mention effect, which has been robust in previous experiments (Arnold et al., 2000, 2007; Brown-Schmidt & Toscano, 2017; Falandays et al., 2020). While there was a clear order of mention effect in the HeShe|They trials, the effect of order was not significant in the HeShe|SheHe trials. Breaking the data down further shows that the expected order pattern appeared for He|She trials, but not She|He Trials. Replication data collection is in progress, to determine whether this is a consistent pattern. With a larger data set, it will also be possible to conduct a dynamic tree-based item response analysis (Cho et al., 2020) which can test additional hypotheses by making a distinction between looks to the competitor character and looks to the distractor characters.\n\n\n\n\nAhn, B., & Conrod, K.

    "text": "A related question is if the model would need separate nodes for gender-unspecified and gender-specified singular they. But since the experiments here only elicit gender-specified they, I focus on that form.↩︎\nAccounts of grammatical gender errors assume the opposite. Grammatical gender marking errors remain common even in highly-proficient learners, particularly if they are native speakers of a language without grammatical gender (e.g., English speakers learning Spanish) (Antón-Méndez, 2010; Grüter et al., 2012). These errors occur when a speaker selects the wrong grammatical gender feature for a word, then produces the pronoun corresponding to that wrong grammatical gender category.↩︎\nHere, I can only claim that information about gendered language forms is added to knowledge about a person, which could but does not necessarily correspond to changing an underlying gender categorization. See Friedman (2014) for a theoretical model and behavioral data about how people revise their original automatic categorizations of a person’s gender.↩︎"

    "text": "A.1 Experiment 1\n\nA.1.1 Experiment 1A: Additional Results\nIn addition to whether the characters used he/him, she/her, or they/them, participants were also asked about the characters’ jobs and pets (Figure A.1). Accuracy matching the 12 jobs to the 12 characters was lower (M = 0.21, SD = 0.41) than for the 3 pets (M = 0.41, SD = 0.49) and 3 pronouns (M = 0.66, SD = 0.47), but not at floor. Neither job nor pet accuracy varied based on the character’s pronouns. Accuracy for the characters’ pets (cat, dog, or fish) was designed as a comparison to pronoun accuracy, and the two were compared in a model including the Character’s Pronouns (contrast coded as in the main analyses) and Question Type (pronoun vs pet, mean-center effects coded) as fixed effects. The most complex model that converged included by-participant random slopes for Question Type (Table A.1). Averaging across the three character pronouns, participants were significantly more accurate for pronoun questions than pet questions (β = 1.17, z = 11.19, p &lt; .001). The interaction between Character Pronoun (they/them vs he/him + she/her) and Question Type was significant (β = 1.45, z = 7.55, p &lt; .001), reflecting that the character pronouns affected accuracy for the pronoun question, but not the pet question. Probing this interaction indicated that for they/them characters, there was no significant difference in accuracy between pronouns and pets (β = 0.21, z = 1.35, p = .18), but that for he/him + she/her characters, pronoun accuracy was higher than pet accuracy (β = 1.65, z = 12.97, p &lt; .001).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Experiment 1A: By-participant mean accuracy in the multiple-choice memory task for each character’s pronouns, pet, and job, with colors indicating the character’s pronouns.

    "text": "A.2 Experiment 2\n\nA.2.1 Pet & Job Questions\nAs in Experiments 1A & 1B, memory for the characters’ 12 jobs was analyzed in order to make sure the task did not show floor effects, and memory for the characters’ 3 pets was analyzed as a less marked comparison to pronouns (Figure A.6). Averaged across conditions, accuracy for jobs (M = 0.37) was numerically higher than in Experiments 1A (M = 0.21) and 1B (M = 0.29). Accuracy for pets was also higher in Experiment 2 (M = 0.54) than in Experiments 1A (M = 0.41) and 1B (M = 0.43). Job and pet accuracy did not vary based on the characters’ pronouns or the PSA and Biography conditions.\nPronoun and pet questions were compared in a model including the Character’s Pronouns (contrast coded as in the main analyses), the Question Type (mean-center effects coded), and the PSA and Biography conditions as fixed effects. The initial model included interactions between Character Pronoun, PSA, and Biography as in the main analyses; the interaction between Character Pronoun and Question Type; by-participant and by-item intercepts; and by-participant and by-item slopes for Character Pronoun and Question Type. In addition to the subset of interactions between fixed effects listed above, the most complex model that converged included by-participant intercepts, by-item intercepts, and by-item slopes for Question Type (Table A.11). Participants were significantly more accurate for pronoun questions than pet questions (β = 1.03, z = 15.59, p &lt; .001), and the interaction between Character Pronoun (they/them vs he/him + she/her) and Question Type was significant (β = 1.50, z = 12.84, p &lt; .001). Probing this interaction indicated that there was no significant difference in accuracy between pronouns and pets for they/them characters (β = 0.05, z = 0.48, p = .63), only for he/him + she/her characters (β = 1.53, z = 18.57, p &lt; .001).

The maximal random effects structures that converged (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2023; Voeten, 2023) only included a subset of those in the main model (Table 4.2). For the by-participant effects, each kept all 3 slopes (AR(1), Order, and Trial Number). For the by-item effects, the HeShe|They reference model included both slopes (Order, Trend), the HeShe|SheHe reference model only included slopes for Trend, and the They|HeShe reference model only included intercepts.\nIn HeShe|SheHe trials (Table A.24), neither the main effect of Order (β = 0.05, z = 0.47, p = .64) nor its interaction with Pronoun Pair (β = 0.06, z = 0.70, p = .49) were significant. In HeShe|They trials (Table A.25), the main effect of Order was significant as anticipated, with participants more likely to be looking at target characters who had been named first in the story than target characters who had been named second (β = 0.22, z = 2.20, p &lt; .05). The interaction between Order and Pronoun Pair was also significant (β = -0.20, z = -2.20, p &lt; .05). Probing this interaction indicated that listeners were less likely to be looking at the target in HeShe|They trials than in HeShe|SheHe and They|HeShe trials when the target was mentioned second (β = 0.17, z = 2.51, p &lt; .05), but not when the target was mentioned first (β = -0.04, z = -0.62, p = .54). In They|HeShe trials (Table A.26), neither the main effect of Order (β = 0.00, z = -0.03, p = .97) nor its interaction with Pronoun Pair (β = 0.14, z = 1.48, p = .14) were significant.\n\n\nTable A.24: Experiment 4: Model results for the effects of Pronoun Pair and Order on the likelihood of looking at the target character (=1) or not (=0).
