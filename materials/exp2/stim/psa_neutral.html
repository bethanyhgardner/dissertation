<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The choice to spay or neuter your pet may be one of the most important decisions you make impacting their long-term health&mdash;and your wallet!</span></strong></h2>

<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Your pet&#39;s health and longevity</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The average lifespan of spayed and neutered cats and dogs is demonstrably longer than the lifespan of those not. A study conducted by Banfield Pet Hospitals on a database of 2.2 million dogs and 460,000 cats concluded that neutered male dogs lived 18% longer, and spayed female dogs lived 23% longer. Spayed female cats in the study lived 39% longer, and neutered male cats lived 62% longer. The reduced lifespan of unaltered pets can, in part, be attributed to an increased urge to roam (exposing them to fights with other animals resulting in injuries and infections), to trauma from vehicle strikes, and to other accidental mishaps. Another contributor to the increased longevity of altered pets is their reduced risk of certain types of cancers.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Curb unwanted behaviors</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Intact dogs are more prone to urine-marking than neutered dogs. Although urine-marking is usually associated with male dogs, females may do it too. Spaying or neutering your dog should reduce urine-marking and may even stop it altogether.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For cats, the urge to spray is extremely strong in those not altered, so the simplest solution is to alter by 5 months old before the problem arises. Neutering solves 90% of all marking issues, even in cats that have been doing it for a while. It can also minimize howling, the urge to roam and fighting with other males.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In both cats and dogs, the longer you wait, the greater the risk of the surgery not doing the trick because the animal has practiced the behavior for a longer period of time, thereby reinforcing the habit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Other behavioral problems that can be alleviated by spay/neuter include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Roaming, especially when females are in heat</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Excessive barking and mounting activity</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While having your pets spayed/neutered can help curb undesirable behaviors, it will not change their fundamental personalities.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Cut costs</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When you consider the potential long-term medical costs incurred for an unaltered pet, the savings afforded by spay/neuter are clear, especially given the plethora of low-cost spay/neuter clinics now available.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Caring for a pet with reproductive system cancer or pyometra can easily run thousands of dollars&mdash;five to 10 times as much as a routine spay or neuter surgery. In cases where intact dogs and cats may fight, treatment of their related injuries can also result in high veterinary costs.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Spread the word</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By spaying or neutering your pet, you can help protect them against certain illnesses, help address unwanted behaviors, save money, and save lives by reducing overpopulation. Contact your veterinarian or your local low-cost spay/neuter clinic to discuss and/or schedule your pet&rsquo;s appointment, and encourage your family and friends to do the same. If your community does not have affordable, accessible spay/neuter and wellness services available, advocate for this funding so that all pet owners have local access to quality medical care for their pets.</span></p>
