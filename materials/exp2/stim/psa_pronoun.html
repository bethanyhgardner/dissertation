<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This guide is created to help anyone learn how to use people&rsquo;s correct pronouns. Everyone in your community should engage in learning, educating, and advocating for the inclusive use of pronouns for all.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What Are Pronouns?</span></strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Pronouns are the words you may like others to use for you in place of your proper name. Some examples include &ldquo;she/her&rdquo; or &ldquo;he/him&rdquo; or gender-neutral pronouns, such as &ldquo;they/them.&rdquo; Here is an example of using &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; in a sentence: </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">John is substituting for me today and they are an incredible mathematician.</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Singular &ldquo;they&rdquo; pronouns have been used in the English language for centuries. If you are still struggling with using this, remember, it takes practice!</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Why Focus on Pronouns?</span></strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You may have noticed that people are sharing their pronouns in introductions, on name tags, and at the beginning of meetings. This gives everyone in the room the opportunity to self identify instead of assuming someone&rsquo;s identity or which pronouns they use. Including pronouns is a first step toward respecting people&rsquo;s identity and creating a more welcoming space for people of all genders.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">How Is This More Inclusive?</span></strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Pronouns can sometimes be a signifier for someone&rsquo;s gender identity, but not always. We do not want to assume people&rsquo;s gender identity based on expression (typically shown through clothing, hairstyle, mannerisms etc.) By providing an opportunity for people to share their pronouns, you&rsquo;re showing that you&rsquo;re not assuming that their gender identity is based on their appearance.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Mistakes and Misgendering</span></strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Misgendering refers to the experience of being labeled by others as a gender other than one that a person identifies with. Because many (not all) associate their pronouns with their gender identity, using the wrong pronouns intentionally or unintentionally is a form of misgendering. If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun when identifying someone, please apologize or say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, and immediately use the right pronoun, i.e. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;This is Alex, she is one of my science students.&quot;</span></em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(you are corrected because Alex uses they/them/theirs pronouns).</span><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;Sorry, they are one of my science students&quot; o</span></em><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">r </span></em>&nbsp;&quot;<em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Thank you, they are one of my science students.&quot;</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Everyone makes mistakes; please take accountability for your mistake and start using the correct pronoun. The important thing to be mindful of is to not unload your guilty feelings on transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people or expect forgiveness. They might have a strong reaction to the misuse of their pronouns and need space to recenter themselves.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Tips for Gender-Neutral Language</span></strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Practice, practice, practice! Use gender-neutral pronouns such as &ldquo;they&rdquo; while visualizing the person who uses them. This is especially useful to do right before you&rsquo;re about to see the person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When addressing groups of people or people whose pronouns you haven&rsquo;t been told, use gender-neutral language such as, &ldquo;siblings,&rdquo; &ldquo;third graders,&rdquo; &ldquo;students&rdquo;, &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;folks,&rdquo; &ldquo;all,&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rsquo;all,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;brothers and sisters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;guys,&rdquo; &ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sir.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Use descriptive language if you do not know a person&rsquo;s gender, pronouns, or name. e.g. Can you give this paper to the person across the room with the white t-shirt and short brown hair?</span></p>
