<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">James Wright was born in Ohio in 1985. They loved animals from an early age, since they grew up with their family&rsquo;s dogs, cats, chickens, and horses. James began volunteering at the local animal shelter in middle school and caring for foster dogs in high school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Their love of the animal world led James to study biology at The Ohio State University. During this time, they also became interested in botany and wanted to learn more about the relationships between plants and animals that exist together in the same environment. A friend recommended a local organization of beekeepers, and James found the perfect combination of their interests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today, James owns their own bee farm, where they raise hives to sell to other beekeepers and produce honey. They are most excited about the free classes they run for the community about creating gardens friendly to pollinating insects, caring for your own beehive, and identifying local plants and animals. James hopes to inspire people to learn more about the environments around them and work towards a sustainable future.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Outside of their farm business, James is kept busy with their 5 and 2 year old daughters, 3 dogs, and an ever-changing number of cats. They also enjoy hiking, photography, woodworking, and trying new recipes that use fresh honey.&nbsp;</span></p>
