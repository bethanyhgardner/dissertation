<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">An animal-lover&rsquo;s journey to keeping his own beehives</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">James Wright was born in Ohio in 1985. He loved animals from an early age, since he grew up with his family&rsquo;s dogs, cats, chickens, and horses. James began volunteering at the local animal shelter in middle school and caring for foster dogs in high school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">His love of the animal world led James to study biology at The Ohio State University. During this time, he also became interested in botany and wanted to learn more about the relationships between plants and animals that exist together in the same environment. A friend recommended a local organization of beekeepers, and James found the perfect combination of his interests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today, James owns his own bee farm, where he raises hives to sell to other beekeepers and produces honey. He is most excited about the free classes he runs for the community about creating gardens friendly to pollinating insects, caring for your own beehive, and identifying local plants and animals. James hopes to inspire people to learn more about the environments around them and work towards a sustainable future.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Outside of his farm business, James is kept busy with his 5 and 2 year old daughters, 3 dogs, and an ever-changing number of cats.&nbsp; He also enjoys hiking, photography, woodworking, and trying new recipes that use fresh honey.&nbsp;</span></p>
