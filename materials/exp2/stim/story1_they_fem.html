<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The sky is their limit: New astronaut gets ready to travel to the ISS</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ashley Green was born in Chicago in 1990, into a family that always encouraged them in their interest in science. As a child, Ashley was fascinated by astronomy and stories of space travel. They learned to fly a plane before learning how to drive and spent as much time as possible in the sky. Ashley got their bachelor&rsquo;s degree in mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology and their PhD in aerospace engineering at Stanford University.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In 2016, Ashley was one of over 18,000 candidates applying to the astronaut training program at NASA, and one of only 10 candidates chosen. Training to be an astronaut takes two years, which Ashley spent flying training jets, learning medical and survival skills, and learning Russian. To get used to zero gravity, Ashley and other recruits flew in a plane that creates around 20 seconds of weightlessness each time it climbs and dives. Because so many people get sick experiencing zero gravity for the first time, astronauts jokingly call this the &ldquo;vomit comet&rdquo; or the &ldquo;weightless wonder.&rdquo; To practice spacewalks, Ashley spent hours working underwater in a massive pool. They say that astronaut training was exhausting, but it was exciting to be working with such a passionate and talented team.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In two months, Ashley will be lifting off for the first time, headed to the ISS for a four-month stay. They will be working with a team of 5 other astronauts from 3 countries. Ashley&rsquo;s primary job will be upgrading and testing robotic tools used to conduct experiments and do maintenance on the ship. Life on the ISS is busy and isolating, but Ashley says they are excited to be one the few people to see the earth from orbit.</span></p>
